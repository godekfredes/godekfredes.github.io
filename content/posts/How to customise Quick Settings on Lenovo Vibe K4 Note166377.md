# 10 Easy Steps to Transform Your Lenovo Vibe K4 Note with These Quick Settings Hacks!

Lenovo's Vibe K4 Note is a feature-rich smartphone that packs quite a punch with its impressive specs and affordable pricing. But did you know that you can transform your Lenovo Vibe K4 Note with some cool settings hacks? In this article, we'll explore some quick and easy steps to get more out of your Vibe K4 Note.

## Step 1 - Enable Developer Options

The Developer Options settings enable you to access advanced features and tweak your phone's performance. To enable Developer Options, navigate to "Settings > About Phone" and tap on "Build Number" seven times until you see a message saying "You are now a developer!"

## Step 2 - Speed up Animations

Animations make the phone feel smoother, but they can also slow down your phone's performance. To speed up animations, go to "Settings > Developer Options" and scroll down to "Window animation scale," "Transition animation scale," and "Animator duration scale." Set each of these options to 0.5x or turn them off altogether.

## Step 3 - Customize Quick Settings

You can customize the Quick Settings panel by selecting the tiles and organizing them in a way that suits your needs. To customize Quick Settings, swipe down from the status bar, tap on the pencil icon, and rearrange the tiles to your liking.

## Step 4 - Activate Split-screen Mode

The Split-screen mode enables you to multitask and use two apps simultaneously on your phone's screen. To activate Split-screen mode, long-press the Recent apps button and select the second app you want to use.

## Step 5 - Enable Battery Percentage Indicator

By default, the Vibe K4 Note displays the battery icon without showing the exact percentage remaining. To enable the battery percentage indicator, go to "Settings > Battery" and toggle on "Battery percentage."

## Step 6 - Turn on the LED Notification Light

The Vibe K4 Note has an LED notification light that blinks when you receive a new message or email. To turn on the LED Notification Light, go to "Settings > Display & lights" and toggle on "LED Notification Light."

## Step 7 - Customize Display Settings

You can tweak the display settings to adjust color temperature, font size, and display size. To customize display settings, go to "Settings > Display & lights" and select the options that suit you.

## Step 8 - Activate One-handed Mode

One-handed mode shifts the keyboard and other UI elements to one side of the screen, making it easier to use your phone with one hand. To activate One-handed mode, go to "Settings > Display & lights" and toggle on "One-handed mode."

## Step 9 - Use Smart Lock

Smart Lock is a convenient feature that lets you unlock your phone automatically when you're in a trusted location or connected to a trusted device. To use Smart Lock, go to "Settings > Security > Smart Lock" and select the option that suits your needs.

## Step 10 - Enable Data Saver

Data Saver mode reduces data usage by blocking background data and compressing images and videos. To enable Data Saver, go to "Settings > Data usage" and toggle on "Data Saver."

In conclusion, these quick settings hacks can transform your Vibe K4 Note and make it a more efficient and enjoyable device to use. They're simple to implement and can significantly improve your user experience. Try them out and see for yourself!
