1. After downloading Giphy from the Mac App Store, we opened the software, and a green square appeared on the screen.
2. We then load the video we wanted to create a GIF of – in this case, a vine – and rearrange the box to fit the video perfectly. Then all we had to do was click “Start Recording” to start creating the GIF – even though you have a maximum of 30 seconds to use, try to use as little as possible as GIF files can be quite big.

3. Once your GIF has been captured, click the Giphy logo in the Menu Bar and select your GIF. You can then resize your GIF to make the file smaller, trim it, so it’s perfect, and even generate a URL for it, ready to be shared. You can also export it normally.
