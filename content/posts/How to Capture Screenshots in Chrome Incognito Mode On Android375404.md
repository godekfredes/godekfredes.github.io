Unlocking The Secret Trick: Take Secret Chrome Screen Captures Without A Trace in Incognito Mode on Android!

There are times when you may want to take a screenshot of something you see on your Android device. However, some apps do not allow screen capture or may show a notification that you've taken a screenshot. But what about taking a secret screenshot in incognito mode? Yes, you can do that through a trick in Chrome browser. Here's how you can take secret Chrome screen captures without a trace in incognito mode on Android!

Step 1: Open "Incognito Mode" on your Chrome Browser

First and foremost, you need to open "Incognito Mode" on your Chrome browser. To do that, open up Chrome, click on the three dots on the right corner of the screen and select "New incognito tab."

Step 2: Navigate to the webpage you want to take the screenshot of

Next, navigate to the webpage that you want to take a screenshot of. Once you have the webpage open, press and hold the power button and the volume down button at the same time, until you hear the shutter sound indicating that the screenshot has been taken.

Step 3: View the screenshot

The screenshot will be saved in the Gallery folder in your Android device. You can now view and edit the screenshot as you normally would.

The Trick!

The trick here is that incognito mode disables all extensions and tools that are installed in your browser. These tools or extensions may display notifications when you take a screenshot. Since incognito mode does not display any notification when a screenshot is taken, you can take a screenshot of any webpage secretly.

Moreover, when you take a screenshot in incognito mode, there is no trace of that screenshot in the browsing history, making it a truly secret screenshot.

Final Thoughts

Taking a screenshot in Chrome's incognito mode on Android may seem like a simple trick, but it can come in handy when you want to take a screenshot secretly without any traces. This trick can be helpful in various scenarios, such as if you want to capture a private message, bank details, or any other confidential information without anyone knowing. However, keep in mind that it’s important to use this trick ethically and responsibly.

Now that you know how to take a secret Chrome screenshot in incognito mode on Android, go ahead and try it yourself!

Since the incognito mode is meant to be private, Google removed the ability to take screenshots starting with Chrome v65 on Android. If you try to take a screenshot of a webpage opened in an Incognito tab, you would see a message saying, “Screenshots are not permitted on this screen.”
The idea behind restricting users from taking a screenshot is the fact that Private browsing is usually opted for when users don’t want to leave any trace, and screenshots serve as proof of the very same.
However, it looks like Chrome is about to regain its ability to take screenshots in the Incognito mode. Google has already enabled the ability to capture screenshots on Incognito mode in the latest Chrome canary browser for Android.
