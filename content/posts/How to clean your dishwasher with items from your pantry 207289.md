Dirty Dishwasher? Here's How to Get it Sparkling Clean Using Only Pantry Staples!

We all know the pain of a dirty dishwasher. Not only does it affect the cleanliness of our dishes, but it also results in a less-efficient cleaning process, leading to wasted time and money. While there are countless dishwasher cleaning products available in the market, they could be expensive and often contain harsh chemicals that can harm both the environment and our health.

Fear not, as there are some simple and easy ways to get your dishwasher sparkling clean using only some pantry staples. These methods are not only effective but also eco-friendly and inexpensive.

Firstly, start with an empty dishwasher. Remove all the dishes and utensils from the dishwasher and follow these simple steps:

1. Vinegar and Baking Soda Method:

- Take a small bowl and fill it with a cup of white vinegar.
- Place the bowl on the top rack of the dishwasher and run a hot water cycle.
- Once the cycle completes, remove the bowl and sprinkle a cup of baking soda at the bottom of the dishwasher.
- Run another hot water cycle, and voila! Your dishwasher is sparkling clean.

White vinegar is a natural acid that helps break down the buildup of minerals and soap scum, while baking soda is an excellent abrasive cleaner that helps to remove any stubborn stains while also eliminating any unpleasant odors.

2. Lemon and Salt Method:

- Cut a lemon in half and sprinkle some salt on the cut side.
- Place the lemon pieces on the top rack of the dishwasher.
- Run a hot water cycle, and your dishwasher will be smelling fresh and clean.

Lemons contain natural acids that help to break down mineral deposits, and salt acts as a mild abrasive to scrub away any grease or grime in your dishwasher.

3. Borax Method:

- Add a cup of borax to the dishwasher detergent compartment.
- Run a hot water cycle, and you're done.

Borax is a natural mineral that acts as a disinfectant that removes stains, grease, and residual detergent in your dishwasher. It also helps to deodorize the dishwasher, making it smell fresh and clean.

In conclusion, a sparkling clean dishwasher not only ensures the safety and cleanliness of your dishes but also prolongs the lifespan of your appliance. Cleaning your dishwasher with natural pantry staples is an eco-friendly and cost-effective way to ensure that your dishwasher is both spotless and well-maintained. So, give these methods a try and enjoy the benefits of a sparkling clean dishwasher!

If you find your dishes aren't clean enough at the end of a washing cycle, it might mean your dishwasher needs a deep cleaning. There are some dishwasher cleaning solutions available for sale at stores, but I've been using this method for years with great success, with items that are already in my home. To clean your dishwasher, all you need is a cup of vinegar and a cup of baking soda, and plan to run two cycles for maximum effectiveness. 

 
## 1. Check all the drains inside the dishwasher.


Poke your head in and really look at the drains and all the crevices of your machine. Chances are some old food has accumulated on the drain covers, which can make your dishwasher ineffective. Remove any food debris from the inside of the dishwasher and wipe down the inside edges of the door, where drippings get caught and the water doesn't reach.

 
## 2. Place a cup of white vinegar on the top rack of your dishwasher.


Put a cup on the top rack, right side up, and fill it with white vinegar. 

 
## 3. Then, run a cycle on the hottest water temperature.


You want the most effective cleaning action on your dishwasher, so the hotter the water, the better.

 
## 4. Sprinkle the bottom of your dishwasher with baking soda.


Once that cycle is done, generously sprinkle the bottom of your dishwasher with baking soda, I find one cup does the trick.

 
## 5. Run one last cycle on the hottest setting, but it can be a quick cycle.


A dishwasher will benefit from a good cleaning once a month or so. It'll ensure the drains are clear of food debris, so it doesn't retain dirty water, and that the machine itself is clean and running well.
