Once you're in your settings, scroll down until you find "Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls." Tap on it, and you'll be taken to a screen that shows you your phone usage for the day.

Step 3: Explore the "Digital Wellbeing" features

Now that you're in the "Digital Wellbeing" section, take some time to explore the different features that are available to you. You can see how much time you've spent on each app, set timers for certain apps, and even set up "focus mode" to help you stay on task.
