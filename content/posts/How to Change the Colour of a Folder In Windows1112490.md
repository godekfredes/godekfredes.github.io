# 5 Secret Hacks To Customize Your Windows: Learn How To Change Your Folder Colors Like A Pro!

Are you tired of the monotonous look of your Windows folders? Do you want to add a little personal touch to your computer? Well, if you're thinking of changing the colors of the folders on your Windows operating system, you're reading the right article!

Here are five secret hacks that will help you customize your Windows and change your folder colors like a pro:

## 1. Use Folder Colorizer 

Folder Colorizer is a powerful utility tool designed to help you change the color of your folders easily. It's a great choice because it's easy to use and allows you to choose from more than 16 million colors. Once you download and install the tool, all you have to do is right-click on the folder you want to customize, select "Colorize!" and choose from the range of colors available.

## 2. Install Libraries and Icons 

Windows allows you to customize more than just your folder's color; you can also add new icons and libraries to personalize your icons. To begin, you need to download libraries and icon packs from third-party websites. These packs come with a range of backgrounds, icons, and color schemes, so you can choose what suits you best.

Once you've downloaded a pack, right-click on the folder you want to customize, go to "Properties," select "Customize," and click on "Change Icon." You can then browse through the folder where you downloaded the icon pack to select from the available icons.

## 3. Use the Batch File Method 

The batch file method is another way to change your folder colors. It involves creating a batch file and running it on your Windows folders. The advantage of using this method is that you can automate the process once you've created the batch file.

To use this method, create a new text file and add the following command in it: "@ECHO OFF COLOR XY" (replace XY with your favorite color). Then save the file with a .bat extension. Ensure that your folder and the .bat file are in the same directory before running it.

## 4. Use the Command Prompt 

For tech-savvy Windows users, using the command prompt is another way to change folder colors. This process involves running a command-line prompt to execute the "attrib" command. This command allows you to change some file attributes, including colors.

To run the command, go to "Start" and type "cmd" in the search bar. Once the command prompt opens, type "attrib +c foldername" and press Enter. Replace "foldername" with the name of the folder you want to change. To change the color, type "attrib -c foldername" and replace the folder name with your folder.

## 5. Use Third-Party Software 

Like the folder colorizer tool, other third-party software can help you customize your folders. Some of these tools include Rainbow Folders, Folder Marker Free, and FolderIco. These tools come with a range of features to help you personalize your folders, including the addition of personalized icons, color schemes, and even emojis.

In summary, customizing your windows folder helps in easy identification of your document, ease of navigation, and adding a personal touch to your computer systems. You can opt for the folder colorizer tool, installing libraries and icons, using the batch file method, the command prompt, or even third-party software. Whichever method you choose, it's essential to ensure that you're using reliable software to avoid damaging your system software. 

Now go ahead and try out these hacks to customize your Windows and change your folder colors like a pro!
