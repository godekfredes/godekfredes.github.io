Revolutionize Your MacOS Network Connections: Discover How To Create Multiple Network Locations For Ultimate Flexibility!

MacOS users know the importance of a stable and reliable network connection. When it comes to establishing network preferences, most of us think of a single profile that we create as the default. However, what if you could have multiple network profiles that meet different needs and preferences? This is precisely what MacOS' network location feature allows you to do.

In this guide, we'll take a deep dive into how to create multiple network locations, and how it can revolutionize your MacOS network connections.

What are Network Locations in MacOS?

Network locations are predefined profiles that allow you to switch between various network settings quickly. This feature allows users to create different network settings, such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi, for specific locations or situations. With network locations, you can switch back and forth between network setup preferences based on different circumstances.

For instance, at home, you may prefer to connect to your wireless network, but in the office, it may be necessary to use a direct ethernet connection to access the corporate network. Network locations allow you to create these custom profiles so you can switch between them effortlessly.

How to Create a New Network Location?

Creating a new network location on MacOS is relatively easy. Follow the steps listed below:

Step 1: Click the Apple icon in the upper left corner of your screen and then select system preferences. 

Step 2: Now click on the network icon. 

Step 3: You should see a location dropdown option that shows your current location. 

Step 4: Select the edit location option, and a network location window will appear. 

Step 5: Click the plus sign, and you can now create a new custom profile with a unique name. 

Step 6: Next, make any necessary changes based on your preferences. 

Step 7: Finally, click on apply changes to save the new network settings.

Switching Between Network Locations

Once you've created multiple network locations, the next step is to switch between them. To switch, use the following procedure:

Step 1: Click on the Apple icon in the upper left corner of your screen, and then select system preferences. 

Step 2: Click on network again. 

Step 3: In the location dropdown, you should see a list of your created network profiles. 

Step 4: Select the desired custom network connection from the list of options. 

Step 5: You're now connected to your new network.

Revolutionize Your MacOS Network Connections - Conclusion

The network location feature in MacOS is often overlooked, but it can be incredibly useful for those who use various networks regularly. By creating multiple network locations, you can save time and access various custom network configurations with just a few clicks.

Whether you're using different networks at home, school, or work, network locations make switching between network preferences simple and seamless. Follow the steps outlined in this guide, and you'll be able to create and switch between custom network profiles in no time!

For the general-purpose network, I can just have MacOS accept an IP address from the DHCP server. However, for the container network, I prefer assigning a static IP address.
Is this possible?
It certainly is. With the help of MacOS Network Locations, you can assign specific configurations for specific networks (or locations) and even define a particular network you want to connect to within a location.
Let me show you how it works.

## Requirements


The only thing you'll need is a device running an updated version of MacOS. This feature works with both wired and wireless connections.
Once you've configured the location exactly how you need it, click Apply to save everything.

 
## Switching to a different Network Location


After you've created all of the network locations you need, MacOS makes it very easy to switch between them. All you have to do is click the Apple menu > Location > [Location name] (select the name of the location you want to use).
And that's all there is to creating and using network locations in MacOS. If you need to get specific with how your MacOS device interacts with a network, this is a great way to go. Just remember, however, if you move from the current location, you'll want to select another. For example, if you have one location for home and one for work, your machine might have trouble connecting to that work LAN with the home settings.
Fortunately, you are now empowered to more easily make that switch.
