# Unlock Mind-Blowing Android Hacks: Learn How to Control your Phone with your Eyes!

Are you tired of using the same old way to control your phone? Are you ready for a change? Then buckle up because today, we are going to discuss the mind-blowing Android hacks that will allow you to control your phone with your eyes!

Yes, you read that right. Thanks to the latest technology, there are now apps available that let you control your phone using only your eyes. It is an incredible breakthrough that can make your life easier and more fun.

So, how does it work? Well, these apps use the front-facing camera of your phone to track the movement of your eyes. Some even use the infrared camera to track your eye movements in low light conditions. Once the app has gathered enough information about your eye movements, it can use that data to control your phone's functions.

Here are some of the things you can do with eye-tracking apps:

## Browse the web

With eye-tracking technology, you can scroll through articles, click on links, and highlight text without ever lifting a finger. It's incredibly convenient, especially when you're reading something lengthy or holding your phone with one hand.

## Take photos

Getting the perfect shot with your phone camera can be challenging, especially when you're trying to capture something in motion. With eye-tracking technology, you can take photos without even touching your phone. Simply look at the camera icon on the screen, and the app will take the picture for you.

## Play games

Games are one of the most fun things you can do on your phone, but sometimes, the controls can be a bit awkward. With eye-tracking technology, you can control your games with ease. For example, in a racing game, you can steer the car by looking left or right on the screen.

## Type messages

Typing messages on your phone can be time-consuming, especially if you're using a small keyboard. But with eye-tracking technology, you can type messages simply by looking at the letters on the keyboard. It may take a bit of practice, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be typing at lightning speed.

Now that you know some of the things you can do with eye-tracking technology, let's talk about some of the apps that make it possible.

## Google Lookout

Google Lookout is an app that uses AI to identify objects, texts, and people around you. It also has an eye-tracking feature that allows you to navigate your phone screen using your eyes. It's an excellent app for people with visual impairments, but anyone can use it to make their life easier.

## Eye-D

Eye-D is another app that uses eye-tracking technology to let you control your phone with your eyes. It has a wide range of functions, including browsing the web, taking photos, and typing messages. It's also highly customizable, so you can adjust the settings to suit your needs.

## Hawkeye Access

Hawkeye Access is an app specifically designed for people with motor impairments. It allows them to control their phone with their eyes, eliminating the need for physical buttons or touchscreens. The app's interface is intuitive, making it easy for anyone to use.

In conclusion, controlling your phone with your eyes may sound like something out of a sci-fi movie, but it's now a reality. With the latest eye-tracking apps and technology, you can browse the web, take photos, play games, and type messages without ever touching your phone. These apps can make your life easier and more enjoyable, so why not give them a try? Unlock the power of your mind today!

Accessibility is progressing beyond simply making words bigger on the screen. Google recently introduced an app for people with speech and motor impairments that makes it easier to use the phone. Read on to see how this fantastic tech works. 

 
## Advanced accessibility


Camera Switches is a new Android accessibility feature that makes it possible to navigate a smartphone using eye movements and facial gestures. It uses the front camera as a switch to set up one action to scan and another to select an item. 
Choose a combination of two facial gestures such as looking in a specific direction, smiling, raising your eyebrows or opening your mouth. 
Once you’re set-up, you can use gestures to scroll through text on a website, browse a playlist and select a song, look through your photos and videos, use your navigation apps, read through virtual menus, place orders, etc. 
Tap or click here to check out Google’s Look to Speak feature, which lets you communicate with others using your eyes.
Google put out a tutorial video that features music from Jason Becker. Jason was a guitar virtuoso before ALS took away his ability to play any instruments, walk, speak or even breathe independently. He communicates with his eyes using a system created by his father. He has even used the system to create new music. 
Jason posted the following on his official Facebook page:
“Great new Google project for people with limited speech and movement. I am touched that it was inspired by me and that they used my music. Thank you my dear friends at Google. I know it will help a lot of people.”
