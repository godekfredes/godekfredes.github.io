Windows 11, Microsoft's latest operating system, has generated a lot of buzz in the tech world. The sleek design, improved performance, and new features have made it a desirable upgrade for many users. However, before you rush to install Windows 11 Version 22H2 on your PC, there is a crucial step you need to take - performing a compatibility check.

In this article, we'll discuss the importance of performing a compatibility check before upgrading to Windows 11 Version 22H2 and provide a step-by-step tutorial to help you perform the check on your PC.

Why is a Compatibility Check Important?

Upgrading to Windows 11 Version 22H2 without performing a compatibility check can cause issues with your PC's hardware and software. For instance, some devices may not work correctly, and critical software may become incompatible with the new operating system.

Therefore, a compatibility check is essential to ensure that your PC can handle the upgrade without any problems. It involves checking if your PC meets the minimum system requirements, if your hardware devices and software are compatible with Windows 11, and if your system configuration can support the new features and capabilities of the operating system.

How to Perform a Compatibility Check

Fortunately, Microsoft has made it easy to perform a compatibility check for Windows 11 Version 22H2. Here's how to do it:

Step 1: Download and Install the PC Health Check App

The first step is to download and install the PC Health Check app, which is available for free from the Microsoft website.

Step 2: Run the App

Once you've installed the app, run it as an administrator. Click on the "Check Now" button, and the app will start scanning your PC to determine its compatibility with Windows 11.

Step 3: Review the Results

After the scan is complete, the app will provide you with a report on your PC's compatibility with Windows 11. If your PC is compatible, you'll receive a green check mark. If it's not compatible, you'll get a red X with a list of the issues that need to be resolved.

Step 4: Address the Compatibility Issues

If you receive a red X indicating compatibility issues, you need to address them before upgrading to Windows 11 Version 22H2. The PC Health Check app will provide recommendations on how to resolve the issues, such as updating drivers or upgrading hardware.

Conclusion

In conclusion, upgrading to Windows 11 Version 22H2 without performing a compatibility check can cause significant issues with your PC's hardware and software. Therefore, it's essential to take the time to perform a compatibility check before upgrading.

## Steps to Check if your PC is compatible with Windows 11 Version 22H2


Now that Microsoft is gearing up to launch the next big update for Windows 11, users are wondering whether their devices will run the version 22H2 update. If you’re confused, let me tell you we found a workaround that reveals if your PC is compatible with Windows 11 version 22H2 or not.
To check if your PC can run Windows 11 version 22H2, you need to use the Registry Editor. The Windows Registry Editor will clearly state whether your PC is compatible with Windows 11 version 22H2, and whether you will receive the update or not. Here’s what you need to do.
1. First, click on the Windows 11 search and type Registry Editor. Next, open Registry Editor from the list of matching results.

2. On the Registry Editor, navigate to this path:
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\TargetVersionUpgradeExperienceIndicators\

You can also copy and paste the path to the Registry Editor’s address bar to jump to the folder directly.
3. On the TargetVersionUpgradeExperienceIndicators folder, select the NI22H2 folder.

4. On the right pane, find the RedReason key.

5. Now, look at the Value field of RedReason. If its value is None, it means your PC has no compatibility issue and can upgrade to Windows 11 version 22H2.

6. Any other value other than None indicates a compatibility issue. For example, if the Value shows TPM UEFISecureBoot, TPM Requirement is not matched.
That’s it! This is how you can check if your PC is compatible with Windows 11 version 22H2 in easy steps.
