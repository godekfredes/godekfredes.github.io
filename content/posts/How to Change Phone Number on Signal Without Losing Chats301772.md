# Unlock the Secret to Changing Your Signal Phone Number Without Losing Your Precious Chats!

Are you tired of juggling multiple devices to keep your conversations safe while changing phone numbers? Do you dread the thought of having to start fresh with a new Signal account and losing all of your previous chats?

Luckily, there's a simple solution to this problem that will save you time and effort: the Signal Transfer feature.

With Signal Transfer, you can seamlessly move your Signal account to a new phone number without losing any of your chat history or contact information. Here's how it works:

1. Download Signal on your new phone and verify your new phone number.
2. Go to your old phone's Signal app, tap on your profile picture, and select "Transfer Account."
3. Follow the prompts to generate a Transfer Code and enter it on your new phone when prompted.
4. Wait for the transfer to complete, and voila! Your Signal account is now linked to your new phone number.

One important thing to note is that Signal Transfer only works for one-to-one chats and group conversations that you are the admin of. If you're part of a group chat that someone else created, you will lose access to that chat when you switch phone numbers.

To avoid that, make sure to take a screenshot of important group chats before you initiate Signal Transfer. Then, once the transfer is complete, you can re-create the group chat and invite everyone back to it.

With Signal Transfer, changing phone numbers no longer means starting from scratch on your messaging app. Try it out the next time you switch to a new phone number and save yourself the hassle of manually migrating all of your data!

Signal, like WhatsApp, also requires an active phone number to sign up, so that you can communicate with other users on the app. Before February 7, 2022, Signal’s accounts were tied to phone numbers, which meant that users could not port their existing accounts to another number.
However, the good news is that the company recently released an update enabling users to change their phone numbers without losing any chats. This essentially means users can now change their phone numbers without losing any chats.
Prior to this update, using a new number meant starting over from scratch and losing all messaging history. But, it won’t happen now as the app will now allow users to keep their chats, groups, and profile information intact while changing their phone numbers. So, if you want to change your Signal phone number without losing chat data, you are reading the right guide.
