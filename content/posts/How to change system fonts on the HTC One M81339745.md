The HTC One M8 comes with a beautiful new Roboto light font, which blends in perfectly with the Sense 6 aesthetics. However, HTC has included a nifty little option to change the system wide fonts on the One M8 as well.
Samsung has been including a similar feature on its Galaxy devices since quite a few years, so it is nice to see that HTC has finally caught up with the Korean giant in this department.
If you are looking to change the fonts on your HTC One M8, follow the steps mentioned below:
Step 1: Head over to Settings -> Display & Gestures and tap the Font Style option.
Step 2: By default, the One M8 ships with only two fonts: Helvetica (my personal favorite) and LCD. In case, you are not a fan of these fonts, you can download additional fonts by using the Get Fonts Online option, which should redirect you to the Play Store and list all the fonts that are compatible with the handset.

Step 3: If you are looking to change the font size, head back to the Display & Gestures menu and tap the Font Size option, where you can make the neccessary adjustments.
The One M8 supports the same type of fonts — FlipFonts — as the Galaxy S5. So, if you had purchased them previously for your Galaxy device, you can easily reuse them on the HTC One M8 as well.
