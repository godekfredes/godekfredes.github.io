# Unleash the Power of Your iPhone: How to Easily Boost Your Battery Life with One Simple Trick!

If you are an iPhone user, then you know the pain of a dying battery. The more you use your phone, the more quickly it drains its battery. And if you are like most people, you probably have a busy schedule and are constantly on the go. This means you need your phone to be fully charged and ready to use whenever you need it.

In this article, we will show you how to easily boost your iPhone's battery life with one simple trick. You don't need any technical knowledge or any special equipment. All you need is your iPhone and a charging cable.

The first step to boosting your iPhone's battery life is to check for apps that are draining your battery. You can do this by going to Settings > Battery. Here, you will see a list of all the apps on your iPhone and how much battery they are using. If you see an app that is using a lot of battery, you can either delete it or limit its use. For example, you can turn off notifications for the app or use it less frequently.

The second step to boosting your iPhone's battery life is to turn off unnecessary features. Some features, such as Bluetooth, location services, and background app refresh, can drain your battery quickly. To turn off these features, go to Settings > General > Background App Refresh. Here, you can turn off background app refresh for all apps or just for specific ones. You can also turn off location services by going to Settings > Privacy > Location Services. And to turn off Bluetooth, swipe up from the bottom of your iPhone's screen and tap the Bluetooth icon.

The third and final step is to use low power mode. Low power mode is a feature in iOS that reduces power consumption by turning off certain features and adjusting settings. To turn on low power mode, go to Settings > Battery > Low Power Mode. When your iPhone's battery level drops below 20%, low power mode will automatically turn on. You can also turn it on manually at any time.

By following these three simple steps, you can easily boost your iPhone's battery life and enjoy longer usage times. With a little bit of effort and attention, you can make sure your phone is always ready when you need it. So go ahead, unleash the power of your iPhone, and never let a dead battery hold you back again!

Some iPhone owners are most comfortable going the official route and using Apple for a replacement. There are some drawbacks to this. Others might choose to use a local phone repair store. You can can also do the replacement yourself, but make sure you go in with your eyes wide open.
Here are three ways you can get a new battery for your iPhone. Choose the one that you’re most comfortable with and that best fits your budget.

 
## Get an official Apple replacement battery


Here’s the first question you need to ask: Is my iPhone still under warranty? If it’s less than 1 year old, or if you have an extended AppleCare+ warranty, then Apple will replace your battery at no charge.
If your phone is out of warranty, then Apple charges $69 for iPhone X, XS, XS Max and XR phones. Earlier iPhones cost $49. These prices are likely more than you would pay for a local repair shop, and definitely more than going the DIY route, but in exchange you get the peace of mind of knowing you have an official Apple battery replacement.
You can either mail your iPhone to Apple or make an appointment at an Apple Store or authorized service location. If you mail it in, you’ll have to wait 3 to 5 business days to get your iPhone back. If you choose the in-person method, a technician will attempt a repair during your visit. If that doesn’t work out, your phone will still need to be mailed in and you’ll need to wait up to 5 business days to pick it up again.
The downside to Apple’s replacement service is the cost and the time you might have to spend without the use of your phone. If you can live with both of those compromises, then this is a fairly worry-free route to getting a new battery. You can get the ball rolling on the repair through Apple’s support site.

## Let a local repair shop replace your battery


If you don’t have the time or the budget for an official Apple repair, then check into a reputable phone repair shop in your area. Prices can vary, so make sure to get a quote for the both the expense and the amount of time it might take.
Read up on reviews for the shop and check to see the repair comes with any sort of warranty in case there are problems with the new battery.

## DIY for your new iPhone battery



Are you a hands-on person? Are you not afraid of tiny screws? A DIY battery replacement might be the way to go if you’re confident in your fix-it skills and you’re looking to save money. Just know that a slip-up could mean bricking your iPhone. You might also compromise the waterproofing on some newer iPhones.
If that doesn’t dissuade you, then your next step is to find the right replacement battery. This is when it pays to find a seller with a good reputation. Check up on reviews. For example, this ScandiTech battery replacement kit for the iPhone 6 Plus costs less than $25 and includes tools, adhesive and full instructions to walk you through the process. It also has good reviews.


 
## A few tips before you DIY:


2. Take your time. Make sure you’ve cleared out a little space in your schedule so you’re not feeling rushed.
3. If in doubt, study up. While your battery kit should come with instructions, you can supplement those with how-to videos on YouTube or with a visit to iFixit’s iPhone repair guides, which offer easy-to-follow illustrated looks at performing surgery on your smartphone.
4. Keep track of all the tiny parts. You will need to work with some very dainty components, so make sure you have a clear work space and a small tray to wrangle the iPhone screws so they don’t get lost.
Now that you know your iPhone battery replacement options, you can choose the approach that makes the most sense for you. Save money and do it yourself, or have a pro handle it for you. Either way, your iPhone will start to feel like its old self once again.
