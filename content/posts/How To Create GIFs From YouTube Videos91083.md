## Step 1: Find Your Favorite YouTube Video

The first step is to find the YouTube video that you would like to turn into a gif. It could be a funny clip, a cat video, or even a part of a music video - the possibilities are endless. Once you have found the video, go to the URL bar and add 'gif' before the word 'youtube', so it looks something like this: https://www.gifyoutube.com/watch?v=WJ1NLyKlBSU.

## Step 2: Trim the Video

After adding 'gif' to the URL, you will be redirected to a new page that offers you various options to customize your gif. The first option is to trim the video by setting the start and end time, so that only the part you want to convert into a gif gets included. You can use the sliders or enter the exact time codes to adjust the duration of your gif.

## Step 3: Add Captions and Filters

Next, you can add captions and filters to your gif by using the tools provided on the right-hand side of the page. You can choose from various font styles and colors, and even adjust the transparency of the captions. Additionally, you can add filters to your gif to enhance its appearance.

## Step 4: Download and Share

Once you have customized your gif according to your preferences, simply click the 'Create GIF' button, and your gif will be generated in a matter of seconds. You can then download it and share it on your favorite social media platform or messaging app.

And there you have it - a hilarious gif created from your favorite YouTube video in just a few simple steps. This is a great way to add a personal touch to your social media posts and share some laughter with your friends and followers.

## 2 Methods to Create GIFs From YouTube Videos


But, hold on, as from now you don’t have to do so, as to avoid this, here we will show you how to create a GIF from a YouTube video very easily. So, now, without wasting much time, let’s get started and explore the tutorial mentioned below.

Well, GIfs.com is a website that lets you turn any YouTube video into a GIF. However, the only problem is that it won’t convert your video into GIF automatically.
You would need to manually select the video portion that you want to turn into GIF. The good thing about GIfs.com is that it offers you lots of editing options.
For example, with GIfs.com, you can easily blur any portion, adjust saturation of the video, invert videos, and more. You need to paste the video link on the website and convert it to a GIF after editing.

 
### 2. GIFRun



GIFRun is another best web tool on the list that can convert any video into GIF. However, just like the above website, GIFRun also requires manual editing. You need to paste the video link on the GIFRun and wait until the web tool fetches the video.
Once fetched, it will provide you wide range of options. To create a GIF, you need to adjust the GIF duration, set the Start time, pixels, etc. Apart from that, GIFRun also allows you to add text to the GIF.
Once done with the editing, just hit the Create GIF button to convert the video into GIF.
