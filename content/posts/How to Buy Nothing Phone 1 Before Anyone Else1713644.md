## How to Buy Nothing Phone 1 Before Anyone Else


If you want to buy Nothing Phone (1) before anyone else, you must participate in the Auction. Right now, there is no other sure-shot way to get hands-on the phone before anyone else.
The Auction is already live and will close on June 23, 2022. To participate in the Auction, you first need to create a StockX account, and if you already have it, you need to log in with your account.
Once the account creation process completes, you need to place a Bid on the DropX product page. Since the auction is live, you can create your account and place your Bid immediately.
1. To create an account with StockX, head to the website and click the Sign-up button.

2. Once created, click on the Bid Now button on the Auction page.

3. To place a bid, click on the Buy or Bid button.

4. Enter the Bid amount and click on the Next button.

5. On the next screen, you need to choose your payment method.

That’s it! This is how you can participate in the Auction and place a Bid.

 
### Important Things to Remember before placing a Bid


You should note a few things before placing a bid or even creating an account with StockX. The company is selling only 100 phones, serializing each phone for the corresponding Bid that wins it.
Your Bid will be charged only if it gets selected within the top 100. If you are a winner, you must wait for approximately 35 business days to get Nothing Phone (1) on your doorstep.
If you live in Mexico and South Korea, you can’t participate in the auction as it’s unavailable in that region. The phone is not fully supported in North America as well.
So, that’s all from us for today. If you don’t want to participate in the Auction, you need to wait until July 2 for the official launch. Meanwhile, you can download & install the Nothing Launcher on your Android to get a taste of the software. If you have any doubts about this, let us know in the comments.
