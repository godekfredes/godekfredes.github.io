# Revolutionize Your Workflows - Convert PDFs to Excel for FREE in Just a Few Clicks!

In today's digital age, business operations and workflows heavily rely on the use of electronic documents. One of the most prevalent types of electronic documents is the Portable Document Format or PDF. However, PDFs are not always the most user-friendly type of electronic document, particularly when dealing with tabular data. That's where converting PDFs to Excel comes in. In this article, we'll explore a quick and easy way to convert PDFs to Excel for free in just a few clicks using an online tool.

## The Challenge

Suppose you're working on a project that requires you to analyze data from a table in a PDF document. The table has tens, hundreds, or even thousands of rows and columns, and there's no easy way to extract or edit the data. You could spend hours manually copying and pasting the information into a new spreadsheet, but that's not only tedious but also prone to errors. So, what can you do instead?

## The Solution - Convert PDFs to Excel

The solution is to convert the PDF document to an Excel spreadsheet. Excel is the most widely used and versatile spreadsheet software, making it an ideal choice for handling tabular data. You will be able to easily slice and dice the data, manipulate it, and perform analysis in Excel, which is almost impossible to do with a PDF.

## PDF to Excel Converters

There are several PDF to Excel conversion tools available, including paid and free alternatives. While some paid converters offer more advanced features, the free versions can often do the job sufficiently well. One such online converter is 'Soda PDF to Excel Converter.'

Having tried many, many options out there, I can tell you one thing is certain: You're unlikely to get a flawless result with any option. You will more often than not have to edit and redo some, if not all, of the formatting of your document to get it to look how you want it. The video above shows what a train wreck of an experience it was to add a PDF (one that originally was an Excel spreadsheet, no less) to Excel using Excel's Import Data from Picture feature. 
On the flip side, the most accurate option in my experience is Adobe's PDF to Excel tool. It consistently gives me the best results. So the steps we'll outline here will cover how to convert a PDF to Excel through Adobe.

 
## How to convert a PDF to Excel
 
## Step 1: Go to adobe.com. Select PDF & E-Signatures, then Online Tools.


If you have a free account, then signing in will give you more access to their online tools.

 
## Step 2: Scroll down until you find the PDF to Excel tool. 


PDF to Excel will be a visible option under Convert from PDF.

 
## Step 3: Upload the PDF, and it will convert to an Excel spreadsheet you can download.


The drawback to this method is that you can only do it for free twice a month. The biggest pro is that it gives you the best converted result of the free options available.
You can see how the original spreadsheet compares to this converted version and that it's pretty darn close. The data transferred accurately and the formatting remains pretty similar to the original.
