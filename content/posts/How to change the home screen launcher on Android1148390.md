Changing up your home screen launcher is a relatively simple method to customize the appearance  performance of your phone,  there are many good choices. It allows you to change how app icons look, where you can put widgets,  the functions  features of your home screen. 

 
## Change your launcher


Head to Settings > App > Configure apps > app permissions. Truthfully it’s far faster to just launch the settings  search for “home.” so, keep in mind the location for this setting may vary based on your device.
From here, you can choose the launcher that shipped with your device or another you may have downloaded. You can always change back to a previous launcher from this same location. You’ll usually find the apps  layout changes you made to the home screen from any of these launchers will be just the way you remember them.

 
## Finding good launchers


Now it’s time to find a launcher. The ay Store aggregates some of the more popular choices into a section that you can access by going to rsonalization > Cool app launchers. 
ile the ay Store tries to use its own natural selection scheme to offer you some choices, allow us to point you to some of our favorites. 
My personal favorite right now is Action uncher 3. Developer  cy is constantly improving the launcher  has even added in details that align with ’s xel uncher. It’s well worth the in-app upgrade for the full version.
If you like to stick close to , there’s always the  Now uncher. However, icons look slightly large on some bigger phones  it doesn’t offer as much customization as others. Speaking of tweaks, you may also like Nova uncher if you want to optimize your home screen to just the way you want. Additionally, Microsoft also has a good offering with its Arrow uncher if you want one that does most of the thinking for you.
Finally, once you download a new launcher you’ll be prompted to select which one to use the first time you hit the home button. You can opt to use that launcher one time only or select it as the new default.
