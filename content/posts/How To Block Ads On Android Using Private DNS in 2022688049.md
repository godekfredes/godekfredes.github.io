Say Goodbye To Annoying Ads On Your Android Device Forever - Here's The Top Secret Method You Need To Know in 2022!

If you're like most Android users, you know the frustration of being bombarded with annoying ads on your device. From pop-ups to banner ads, it seems like we can't escape them. But what if I told you that there's a top secret method that can help you get rid of those pesky ads once and for all? Well, the good news is that there is, and I'm going to reveal it to you right here, right now.

The method I'm talking about is called ad-blocking. Ad-blocking is the process of blocking ads from displaying on your smartphone or tablet. The technology has been around for years, but it's only recently become popular among Android users.

Now, you might be thinking, "But isn't ad-blocking illegal?" The answer is no. Ad-blocking is not illegal, and it's not even against Google's terms of service. However, Google doesn't allow ad-blocking apps on the Google Play Store, so you'll have to download and install them manually.

So, without further ado, let me show you the top secret method you need to know to block ads on your Android device in 2022!

Step 1: Download an Ad-Blocking App

The first step in blocking ads on your Android device is to download an ad-blocking app. There are several ad-blocking apps available on the internet, but not all of them are reliable or safe to use.

One great ad-blocking app that you can use is AdGuard. AdGuard is a free, open-source ad-blocking app that's easy to use and highly effective. To download the app, simply visit the AdGuard website and download the APK file.

Step 2: Install the Ad-Blocking App

Once you've downloaded the ad-blocking app, you'll need to install it on your Android device. To do this, you'll need to enable the installation of apps from unknown sources on your device. To do this, go to your device's settings, then security, and enable the installation of apps from unknown sources.

Once you've enabled the installation of apps from unknown sources, open the APK file you downloaded earlier and follow the on-screen instructions to install the app on your device.

Step 3: Enable Ad-Blocking

Once you've installed the ad-blocking app, you'll need to enable ad-blocking in the app's settings. To do this, open the app and go to the settings menu. From there, enable ad-blocking and choose the types of ads you want to block.

Step 4: Enjoy Ad-Free Browsing

Congratulations, you've successfully blocked ads on your Android device! You can now enjoy ad-free browsing on your smartphone or tablet.

In conclusion, if you're tired of being bombarded with annoying ads on your Android device, ad-blocking is the answer you've been looking for. With the top secret method I've revealed to you today, you can say goodbye to annoying ads forever and enjoy a more seamless browsing experience. Give it a try today and see the difference for yourself!

When it comes to blocking system-wide ads, rooting seems to be an option, but users rarely root their devices these days. Also, rooting invites risks like phone brick, security problems, etc.
What if I tell you that you can remove ads from your Android without gaining root access? This is possible with the Private DNS option of Android. Google has already introduced a new feature known as ‘Private DNS’ or DNS over TLS on Android Pie.
For those unaware, it’s a feature that allows users to easily change or connect to different DNS on Android. The Private DNS option of Android Pie will enable users to set any particular DNS server for WiFi and Mobile networks in one place rather than changing it one by one. So, to block ads on Android, you need to switch to Adguard DNS.

 
### What is Adguard DNS?


According to the official site, AdGuard DNS is a foolproof way to block internet ads that don’t require installing applications. It’s free and compatible with every device. The key thing about AdGuard DNS is that you get rootless systemwide ad-blocking on Android devices.
That means you no longer need to root your device or play with Chrome flags to disable ads on Android. So, in this article, we will share a working method that would help you block ads using Private DNS on Android.

 
## Steps to Block Ads on Android Using Private DNS


Please ensure that your phone runs on Android 9 Pie or above. If it’s running on Pie, follow some simple steps given below.
1. First, open your Android app drawer and tap on Settings.
2. Under the Settings tab, you must select Network & Internet or Wireless & Networks.
3. Under the Network & Internet Settings, select Private DNS.

4. Now, you need to select the option Configure Private DNS.
5. Under the hostname, type in 'dns.adguard.com'

6. Save the settings and open the Google Chrome browser.
7. On the URL bar, enter "Chrome://flags" and hit Enter.

8. Now search for ‘DNS’ and disable the Async DNS option.

9. Now enter "chrome://net-internals" in the URL bar and hit enter.

10. Select the DNS tab and tap on the Clear Cache option.

That’s it! You are done! Now restart your chrome browser to apply the changes.
Adguard DNS won’t block all ads, but it will block the most annoying ones. The method shared above would remove ads from every webpage. I hope this article helped you! Please share it with your friends also. If you have any doubts about this, let us know in the comment box below.
