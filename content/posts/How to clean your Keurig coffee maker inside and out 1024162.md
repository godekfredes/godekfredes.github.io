If you are a coffee lover, then a Keurig coffee maker is your best friend. It is a handy and quick way to brew coffee. But over time, the coffee maker becomes dirty due to grease, grime, and coffee stains, and you may end up tossing it out or purchasing a new one. But don't worry, we have good news for you!

In this article, we will share some secret tricks to revive your dirty Keurig coffee maker and make it look and taste amazing again. We will discover how to clean your Keurig inside and out like a pro!

Cleaning the External Parts:

The external parts of the Keurig machine require regular cleaning to maintain their shine and prolong their life. Here are some tips to clean the external parts of the Keurig machine:

1. First, unplug the machine and remove the detachable parts like the drip tray and water reservoir.

2. Take a clean and damp cloth and wipe the surface of the machine, giving a special attention to the Keurig logo area and handle area.

3. If the Keurig machine has a stainless steel body, then make a mixture of vinegar and warm water in equal parts and dip a clean microfiber cloth into it to wipe the machine's exterior. Wipe the machine in the direction of the grain to avoid any scratches.

4. Still, if the machine has any tough stains or grime, then make a paste of baking soda and water and apply it to the affected area. Leave it for 10 minutes, then wipe it off with a cloth.

Cleaning the Internal Parts:

Now comes the trickiest part of cleaning the Keurig machine-the internal parts. This part of the machine can harbor bacteria and mineral scales, making coffee taste foul. So, it is essential to clean the internal parts regularly to maintain the quality of your coffee. Here are the steps to clean the Keurig machine's internal parts:

1. Start by unplugging the Keurig machine and removing the water reservoir.

2. Take a clean cloth and wipe the surface of the machine, ensuring to remove any debris or coffee grounds.

3. Take a clean and sharp object like a paper clip and clean the needle that punctures the top of the K-Cup. Insert the paper clip into the needle to unclog any coffee grounds or debris.

4. Now, take the water reservoir and fill it with a solution of equal parts of water and white vinegar. Place it back into the Keurig machine and run a brew cycle without inserting a K-Cup. Repeat this process until the water reservoir is empty.

5. After this, take the water reservoir out, refill it with water, and run the brew cycle again to rinse the machine. Repeat the brewing cycle until the machine is free from any vinegar residue.

Conclusion:

Cleaning your Keurig coffee maker is essential to maintain its life and enjoy the coffee's full flavor. Follow these tricks mentioned above to clean your Keurig machine inside and out like a pro. Not only will this prolong the life of your Keurig machine, but it will also give you the best tasting coffee every time!

Of course, you can choose avoid the topic, but then how would you know whether your coffee is dark due to the roast or as a result of all the potential grime in there? Or maybe you can just learn how to clean your Keurig.
Whether you use pods or reusable K Cups, a Keurig coffeemaker has many nooks and crannies where buildup and mold could hide, so it's important to keep it as clean as possible. Whatever runs through your Keurig may also end up in your body, after all. 

 
## How to clean your Keurig coffeemaker


Materials needed:

 
WaterWhite vinegar or descaling solutionDish soap and access to a sinkA mug 


Estimated time:

 
About one hour
 
## How often should you clean your Keurig coffeemaker?


How often you use your Keurig will help determine how often you should clean it. Keurig recommends washing your water reservoir weekly and descaling your machine every three to six months. 
The Keurig's pod holder is the cup-shaped enclosure where you put K-cups to brew the coffee. To remove the pod holder, open the lid on your Keurig and locate the needles. Then push the pod holder from the bottom upwards with your fingers until it pops out. Be very careful with the needles when removing the pod holder! 
If you want to clean the needles on the brewer, you can use a pin or a paper clip to dislodge any grounds that may be slowing down your machine. I also wipe down the exterior of the brewer at this point.
Fill the water reservoir halfway with white vinegar, then top it with water up to the fill line. 
All the old coffee grounds and mineral buildup inside of the brewer should start coming out into the mug. I found old grounds were still coming out of the Keurig even after the water reservoir was half empty, so it's important to finish the process and run through the entire contents of the water reservoir.
While the vinegar soaks inside of the Keurig, remove the water reservoir again and wash it well to get rid of any lingering white vinegar but don't dry the inside of it as you don't want lint to stick to the inside of it. If there is lint in your reservoir, it can clog your Keurig or end up in your drink.

 
## Why are there lingering tastes from past brew cycles?


If you find that taste from past cups transfers into fresh brews, you may benefit from running rinse cycles in between cups. This is especially helpful if you brew different drinks like hot cocoa or tea. 

 
## What are the signs that I need to clean my Keurig?


Watch for signs that your coffeemaker needs a deep clean:

 
Lingering tastes from past brews that won't go away with rinsing cyclesGranules in your brewed mugFoul or mildewy smellsSlow water trickleMineral buildup on machineDescale prompt is onMachine takes too long to fill a cup or doesn't fill it all the way
 
## What do I do if I have hard water?


If mineral buildup is an issue with your Keurig, you may consider using filtered water in your reservoir instead of water straight from the tap. Some people also skip the filter on their Keurig, but if you have hard water, a filter is vital.
Hard water can cause mineral buildup that can affect the taste of your coffee and performance of the machine. 

 
## How can you clean the Keurig without vinegar?


While running the rinse cycles in this process will get rid of the white vinegar inside the brewer, Keurig offers a descaling solution to remove mineral buildup that is an odorless alternative to white vinegar.
