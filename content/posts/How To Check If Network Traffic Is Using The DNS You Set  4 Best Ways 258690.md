As businesses continue to rely on cloud-based technologies, proper network traffic management becomes increasingly critical. One aspect of this is maintaining proper Domain Name System (DNS) settings to ensure that all network traffic passes safely through the predetermined resources. However, malicious actors often use sophisticated techniques to bypass DNS settings and gain unauthorized access to network connections. Here are four genius ways to check if your network traffic is sneakily sidestepping your DNS settings.

**1. Use a Network Monitor**

A network monitor is an essential tool for examining traffic activity in real-time. It allows you to see data traffic rates and traffic types, and filter results to identify if traffic is sneaking through via alternative DNS sources. You can use a free network monitor tool such as PRTG Network Monitor to gain visibility into the origins of your incoming and outgoing traffic.

**2. Analyze DNS Query Logs**

DNS queries typically rely on a defined set of rules, and legitimate queries follow these rules throughout. Analysing DNS query logs can help identify anomalies that could indicate an attack. You can use open-source tools such as Wireshark and SolarWinds DNSstuff to identify strange DNS queries and isolate potential culprits behind them.

**3. Check for Rogue DHCP Server**

Using a rogue DHCP server can easily sidestep DNS settings by overriding them and manipulate client configuration inappropriately. If a rogue DHCP server is responsible for bypassing the DNS settings, it will affect all devices on the network. You can identify this by checking your DHCP server address range and comparing its address with the one defined by your IT team.

**4. Use a Passive DNS Service**

A passive DNS service like Farsight Security DNSDB can help identify DNS anomalies through historical record-keeping. It monitors changes made to DNS records to identify malicious activities in one's network. With this information, you can isolate and block malicious domains and prevent network security breaches.

In conclusion, protecting your network from unauthorized access starts with an active approach towards network monitoring and identifying potential areas of vulnerability. The above methods can help you identify if your DNS settings are breached and take the necessary actions to regain control over your network. Keep in mind that these techniques should be used in combination with a robust security strategy to ensure your business stays ahead of the ever-evolving threat landscape.

When you enter a domain name in the address bar, the DNS server looks at the IP Address associated with the domain name. Once done, it matches the IP Address and then comments on the webserver of the site you are visiting.
After this process is done, you are served the actual webpage. The process is automatic, but sometimes you might face a slow internet issue due to an unstable DNS server. The DNS server assigned by ISP is usually unstable and results in slow internet.
Therefore, it’s always best to choose a public DNS server for better speed & security. We have already shared a step-by-step guide on how to change the DNS server on Windows 11. This article will discuss checking if the network traffic is using the DNS resolver you have set.

 
## 4 Ways To Check If Network Traffic Is Using The DNS You Set


After changing the DNS server, it’s best to test if the network traffic passes through the servers you have configured. So, let’s check out how to check if network traffic uses the DNS resolver you have set in Windows 11.

 
### 1) Using DNSLeakTest


DNSLeakTest is a website that tells you about the DNS leak. You can use the same website to find out whether the network traffic is using the DNS resolver you have set or not.
1. First of all, open your favorite web browser and visit this webpage.
2. Now, you will see a screen like below. Here you need to click on the Standard test button.

3. Now, wait for a few seconds until the website runs a DNS leak test. Once the process is completed, you need to check the ISP column. The ISP column will reflect the name of the DNS server you are using.


 
### 2) Using DNS leak


Well, DnsLeak is another best website that can help you find your DNS service provider name. Here’s how to use DnsLeak on Windows 11.
1. First of all, open your web browser and visit this webpage.
2. Now, you will see a screen like below. You need to click on the Start button.

3. Now, you will see the details of your IP Address. The ISP section will show you the name of the DNS server you are using.


 
### 3) Check DNS resolver via Command Prompt


We will use the Command Prompt utility to find the DNS resolver name in this method. But, first, follow some of the simple steps shared below.
1. First, open the Windows 11 search and type in Command Prompt. Next, right-click on the Command Prompt and select Run as Administrator.

2. On the command prompt, enter ‘nslookup‘ and hit the Enter button.

3. Now, you need to look at the Default Server field. It will show you the name of the DNS provider. It will also show you the DNS server address under the Address.

That’s it! You are done. This is how you can check the DNS resolver name via Command Prompt in Windows 11.

 
### 4) Check DNS Resolver name via Router Login Page


The process might vary depending on the router you are using. However, you need to implement the same steps for all routers.
1. Open your web browser and sign in to your router portal. You need to use your IP Address to access the router portal page.
2. On the main page, navigate to the Network Tool and select the nslookup option.
3. Run the nslookup tool, and you will see the DNS resolver name.
That’s it! You are done. This is how you can check if network traffic is using DNS resolver you have set.
These are the four easy methods to check if your network traffic is using DNS resolver you have set. I hope this article helped you! Please share it with your friends also. If you have any doubts about this, let us know in the comment box below.
