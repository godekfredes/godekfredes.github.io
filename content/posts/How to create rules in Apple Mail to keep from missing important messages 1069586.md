Stop Missing Important Emails! Learn How to Create Life-Saving Rules in Apple Mail!

If you use Apple Mail, you know how important it is to stay organized and on top of your emails. But what if you miss an important email because you were too busy or didn't see it in time? That's where email rules come in! In this article, we'll explain how to create rules that can help you stay on top of your inbox and never miss an important email again.

What are email rules?

Email rules, also known as filters or automation, are settings that you can set up in your email client to automatically perform specific actions on incoming emails. For example, you could create a rule that automatically moves all emails from your boss into a specific folder, or a rule that marks all emails from a specific address as read.

Why are email rules important?

Email rules are important because they help you stay organized and save time. If you receive a lot of emails every day, it can be difficult to stay on top of them all. Email rules allow you to automate certain tasks, like sorting or labeling messages, so you can focus on the most important ones.

What are some common email rules?

Here are some common email rules that you can create in Apple Mail:

1. Move emails from a specific sender to a folder

If you're receiving a lot of emails from a specific sender, you can create a rule that automatically moves all emails from that sender to a specific folder. To do this, select an email from the sender, then choose "Message" > "Create Rule From Message" from the menu bar. From there, you can choose the folder you want to move the emails to, and any other actions you want to perform (like marking the emails as read).

2. Mark emails from a specific sender as read

If you want to make sure that you never miss an email from a particular sender, you can create a rule that automatically marks all emails from that sender as read. To do this, select an email from the sender, then choose "Message" > "Create Rule From Message" from the menu bar. From there, you can choose "Mark as Read" as the action.

3. Flag emails with specific keywords

If you receive a lot of emails with specific keywords (like "urgent" or "important"), you can create a rule that automatically flags those emails for you. To do this, go to "Mail" > "Preferences" from the menu bar, then click on "Rules." Click on the "+" button to add a new rule, and then set the rule criteria (like "Subject contains 'urgent'") and the action ("Flag Message").

4. Notify you when you receive an email from a specific sender

If you want to make sure that you never miss an email from a particular sender, you can create a rule that sends you a notification every time you receive an email from them. To do this, select an email from the sender, then choose "Message" > "Create Rule From Message" from the menu bar. From there, you can choose "Play Sound" or "Display Notification" as the action.

5. Block emails from specific senders

If you're receiving a lot of spam or unwanted emails from a specific sender, you can create a rule that automatically blocks all emails from that sender. To do this, go to "Mail" > "Preferences" from the menu bar, then click on "Rules." Click on the "+" button to add a new rule, and then set the rule criteria (like "From contains 'viagra'") and the action ("Delete Message" or "Move to Junk").

Conclusion

Email rules are a lifesaver for anyone who receives a lot of emails. They can help you stay organized, save time, and make sure that you never miss an important email again. In this article, we've shown you how to create some common email rules in Apple Mail. Give them a try and see how they can help you stay on top of your inbox!

But where is it?
You know it's there somewhere, but that crucial missive has somehow been lost in the shuffle. Unfortunately, it happens a lot. This is especially so because I have multiple email accounts configured in Apple Mail and given how much spam gets caught up in the mix, it's really easy to miss something.
To avoid such a calamity, I make use of the rule feature found in Apple Mail. Within Apple's email client you can create specific rules that automatically manage incoming emails and even automate tasks such as replying to or deleting messages. With this feature you can create rules that automatically send notifications to the macOS desktop, set the color of the message, play a sound, automatically reply to the message, redirect the message, delete the message, mark it as read or flagged, and/or run an AppleScript. You can also create a single rule that contains multiple actions.
I'm going to show you how to create your first Apple Mail rule. It's much easier than you think and it's built right into the app.Â

## Requirements


We'll be working on the desktop version of Apple Mail, so you'll need a MacBook or iMac with an updated version of macOS. Of course, you'll also need an email account (or multiple accounts) configured.
That's it. Let's make some rules.

 
## Creating your first Apple Mail rule
 
### 1. Open Apple Mail Preferences


Open Apple Mail and then click Mail > Preferences. In the resulting pop-up window (Figure 1), click Rules.

 
### 2. Create a rule


In the rule tab (Figure 2), click Add Rule.

 
### 3. Customize your rule


Let's create a simple rule that sets the background color of a message that arrives from a specific sender. This makes it very easy to pick out those messages as the color will appear in the email pane. In the New Rule configuration window (Figure 3), we'll set it up like so:

 
Name - give it a unique name (such as EMAIL FROM JACK WALLEN).Under the "If any of the following conditions are met" section, select all, change "contains" to "is equal to", and finally type the email address of the sender.Under the "Perform the following actions" section, select "Set Color of Message", then select "of background", and finally select a color from the final drop-down.


After you take care of the above, click OK and you'll be prompted if you want to apply the new rule to the messages already in your Inbox. Click Don't Apply and then close out the preferences window.
Now, when a new message arrives from that sender, you'll see it appear with the background color you've set. No more missing those important missives from your most important contacts.
You can get very creative with your rules and even create rules with multiple actions. I will say, however, that I've found two actions in the Apple Mail rules (play a sound and display a notification) are pretty unreliable. You can test those actions to see if they work better for you, but your mileage may vary.
And that's all there is to create rules in Apple Mail to help ensure you don't miss out on important communications.
