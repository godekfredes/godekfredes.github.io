If you double click on the example.jpg, Windows 10 knows it’s an image file and will open it with the Photo Viewer. Similarly, if you double click on the .mp4 or .mkv file, Windows 10 will open the media player’s file.
Since Windows knows which app to open when the user doubles click on any particular file extension, it disables the file extension preview. However, setting up Windows to show file extensions could be extremely helpful for security. For example, a file named ‘malware.jpg.exe’ will appear to you as ‘malware.jpg’ in the file explorer, making you think that it’s just a picture.
