# Unlock Secret iPhone Hack: Change Safari Download Location with One Simple Trick!

Are you tired of your iPhone automatically saving downloads to your default location? Do you want to have more control over where your downloaded files end up? Well, we have good news for you. There is a secret iPhone hack that allows you to change your Safari download location with just one simple trick. Here's how to do it:

Step 1: Download a File Manager App

The first step in changing your Safari download location is to download a file manager app. This app will allow you to access and manage the downloaded files on your device. There are many file manager apps available in the App Store, but we recommend using the Documents by Readdle app.

Step 2: Create a New Folder

Once you have downloaded your file manager app, go ahead and create a new folder where you want your Safari downloads to be saved. You can name this folder whatever you like. It is important to remember the name of this folder, as you will need it later.

Step 3: Copy the Folder Path

After you have created your new folder, navigate to it in your file manager app. Once you are in the folder, tap on the "i" icon located next to the folder name. This will display the folder path. Copy this path to your clipboard.

Step 4: Use Shortcuts to Change Download Location

Now that you have your folder path copied, it's time to use a shortcut to change the Safari download location. To create the shortcut, follow these steps:

1. Open the Shortcuts app on your iPhone.

2. Tap the "+" icon in the top right corner to create a new shortcut.

3. Tap "Add Action" and search for "Get Variable".

4. Tap "Get Variable" and then tap "Text" to create a new variable.

5. Name the variable "Download Path" and paste the folder path you copied in step 3.

6. Tap "Done" to save the variable.

7. Next, search for "Safari" and tap "Get Current Webpage".

8. Tap "Add Action" and search for "Download File".

9. Tap "Download File" and then tap the "Save To" option.

10. In the "Save To" field, enter the variable name "Download Path".

11. Tap "Done" and then give your shortcut a name.

12. Tap "Done" again to save the shortcut.

Step 5: Use Your New Shortcut

Now that you have created your shortcut, it's time to start using it. Whenever you want to download a file using Safari, simply tap on the share icon and select "Shortcuts". Choose your new shortcut from the list, and the file will download to the folder you specified.

Congratulations, you have successfully changed your Safari download location using a secret iPhone hack! With this simple trick, you can have more control over your downloaded files and keep your device organized.

In Summary


All the files you download in Safari on your iPhone are saved to the Downloads folder under iCloud Drive.
If you’re someone who uses the free (5GB) iCloud storage plan on their iPhone, this might be a concern to you.
Hence, it’s wise to change the download location in Safari on your iPhone to your device’s local storage.







Fortunately, there’s a way around this: it involves changing the download location in Safari on your iPhone or iPad. And, the following guide demonstrates how to do this on an iPhone or iPad running iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, respectively.

 
## Steps to Change Download Location in Safari


Follow the steps below to change the default download location in Safari on your iPhone or iPad:

 

Open Settings.
Scroll down and select Safari from the list of apps.

Under GENERAL, click on Downloads.

On the STORE DOWNLOADED FILES ON navigation dialog, click on the dropdown button next to On My iPhone and tap on a folder to change the download location to the Downloads folder under your iPhone’s (or iPad’s) internal storage. Alternatively, if you wish to choose another storage location for your Safari downloads, tap on Other and select the folder (or create a new one by hitting the new folder icon on the top-right corner) under On My iPhone.

Hit Done.



Once you do that, Safari will now save your new downloads to your preferred folder of choice you just set as the default location for downloads on your iPhone or iPad. Bear in mind, though, that your existing downloads will continue to remain in the old location—iCloud Drive—and you’ll have to move them manually to the new folder if you wish to keep all your downloads in one place.
At any point, if you wish to change the file download location again, repeat the same steps.

 
## Setting the Download Location for Safari to the Folder of Your Choice


Using the guide above, you can easily change the download location for Safari on your iPhone or iPad from its default iCloud Drive location to some other folder/your preferred location of choice on the internal storage.
As we’ve already mentioned, this will spare you the trouble of going into the Files app to move files and clean up your iCloud Drive. However, as it turns out, this isn’t the only reason why you would want to undergo this process, as a lot of the time, it may also be out of preference to be in control of the app’s behavior.
