This prompt asks you to select between Public and Private Networks. Whether you are connecting to a wireless or cable network; Windows will ask you what kind of Network and settings you want to use.

 
### Private & Public Network Profile


Generally, there are two types of networks – Private and Public. When you set a network profile to Public, your device won’t be visible to other devices on the same Network. That simply means other devices on the network won’t be able to access your files, printers, etc.
Similarly, when you set a network profile to Private, your device will be discoverable on the networks. This means other devices on the network can access your files, printers, and other things.
Both of the network profiles use different firewall settings. You can also use third-party firewall apps on Windows to customize these two profiles as per your preference.
