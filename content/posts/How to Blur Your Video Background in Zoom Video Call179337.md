# ðŸ’¥Attention Zoom users: Quit boring video calls and stand out with this AMAZING hack to blur your background!ðŸ¤©

Are you tired of attending video calls on Zoom and feeling shy about your surroundings? Maybe you have a messy room or a distracting background that you don't want others to see during a call. Well, we have good news for you! Zoom offers a feature that allows you to blur your background and remain the focus of the meeting. 

This feature is incredibly easy to use, and you don't need any technical expertise to implement it. Here's how you can blur your background on Zoom:

1. Open Zoom and click on the settings icon (gear icon) on the right-hand side of the screen.
2. Click on the "Virtual Background" option.
3. Here, you will see various pre-loaded virtual backgrounds that you can use to cover your actual background. You can also upload your own images by clicking on the "+" icon.
4. To blur your background, select the "Blur" option, and your surroundings will be blurred out.

That's it! Now when you attend a video call on Zoom, your background will be blurred, and you can remain the focus of the discussion. This feature is incredibly useful, especially for those who work from home and have a chaotic environment around them. 

However, it's important to note that this feature works best with a plain background, as it can sometimes struggle to differentiate between foreground and background objects. Therefore, it's recommended to sit in front of a plain wall, preferably with good lighting, which makes it easier for the feature to blur out the background.

In conclusion, if you're a Zoom user and want to stand out during video calls, this amazing hack to blur your background is just what you need. It's a quick and easy solution that can transform your surroundings and create a more professional look. Give it a try, and you'll see the positive impact it can have on your meetings!
