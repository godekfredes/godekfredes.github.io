Are you one of those people who constantly highlights text on your computer or mobile device but find the default yellow color to be a bit boring? Well, you're not alone. Highlighting is a very useful tool for keeping track of important information, but there's no rule that says you have to stick to the default color. In fact, there's an array of color options available for customizing your highlighted text that most people aren't aware of. In this article, we will explore some of the tips and tricks for changing your text highlight color like a pro.

Tip #1: Use Keyboard Shortcuts

The quickest way to change your highlight color while working in Microsoft Word or Google Docs is to use the keyboard shortcut. On a Windows PC, press Ctrl+Shift+H to access the Highlight Color drop-down menu, and select the color you want. For Mac, press Command+Control+H, and choose the color. This method is much faster than searching through the menus for the highlight options.

Tip #2: Install Highlighter Tools

If you're looking for a more flexible approach to highlighting text with a variety of color options, consider installing a third-party highlighter tool. Several applications offer more options and a range of additional features to enhance your highlighting experience. Some popular options include Highlighter, Hypothesis, and LiquidText.

Tip #3: Customizing your highlighter color

Most applications that offer the highlight tool also provide an option for changing the color. In Microsoft Word and Google Docs, you can do this by right-clicking on the text you want to highlight, clicking on the highlight option, and selecting "More Colors". From there, you can choose from the preset colors or create your own by adjusting the RGB values. This way, you can ensure that your text highlighter matches your branding or personal preference.

Tip #4: Use Color-coded Highlighting

When highlighting a text, you don't have to stick to just one color. You can also use color-coded highlighting to help differentiate between different types of information. For example, you could use green for important dates, red for key facts, and purple for quotes. This way, you can quickly see which pieces of information are related and easily identify the most critical points.

Tip #5: Avoid Overuse

While highlighting can be a helpful tool, overusing it can become counterproductive. Dissimilar to the objective of highlighting, overuse can reduce clarity and make the entire document appear like a thick layer of highlighter ink. Therefore, it is essential to use it only where necessary and refrain from overdoing it.

In conclusion, highlighting is a very useful tool for tracking the most critical information, and it's all the more versatile when you know how to adjust the color background. Therefore, try out the tips and tricks highlighted in this article for more efficient use of the highlighter tool.
