# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Tell If Someone Blocked You On Discord With These 5 Simple Tricks!

Discord is a popular communication app that has been used by millions of people around the world. It allows users to chat, voice call, and video call with friends, family, and colleagues. However, there might come a time when you notice that someone on your contact list has stopped responding to your messages. The question then arises, have they blocked you on Discord? In this article, we’ll share 5 simple tricks to help you figure out if someone has blocked you on Discord.

## Trick 1: Check Your Mutual Servers

The first trick to know if someone blocked you on Discord is to check your mutual servers. If you were in any mutual servers with the person you suspect has blocked you, check if you can still see them on the member list. If not, it could be a sign that they’ve blocked you. However, do bear in mind that they might have left the server or been kicked out. So, this trick should be used in combination with other tactics.

## Trick 2: Send A Direct Message

If you suspect someone has blocked you on Discord, try sending them a direct message. If they have blocked you, you won’t be able to send the message, and it will show an error message. If the message goes through but you don’t receive a response, it could be a sign that they have either blocked you or are not interested in engaging with you.

## Trick 3: Check If You Can See Their Status

Discord has a feature that allows users to set their status, such as ‘Online,’ ‘Idle,’ or ‘Offline.’ If someone has blocked you, you won’t be able to see their status at all. If this is the case, it’s an indicator that you might have been blocked.

## Trick 4: Check Conversation History

Another way to tell if someone has blocked you on Discord is by checking your chat history with them. If you can’t access the chat history or all previous messages have disappeared, it’s likely that they have blocked you. However, if you’re unable to view the chat history, it could also be a technical issue, so it’s important to double-check using other tricks.

## Trick 5: Create A New Account

The final trick to know if someone has blocked you on Discord is by creating a new account. Once you’ve created a new account, try searching for the person you suspect has blocked you. If you can’t find them, there’s a possibility that they’ve blocked you. However, it’s essential to bear in mind that they might not have blocked you, and they have their privacy settings on or have left the app.

In conclusion, these are 5 simple tricks you can use to know if someone has blocked you on Discord. Remember, if someone has blocked you, don’t take it to heart. There are many reasons why someone might block you, and it doesn’t mean that there is anything wrong with you. Just take it as an opportunity to move on and continue enjoying the app with other friends and communities.
