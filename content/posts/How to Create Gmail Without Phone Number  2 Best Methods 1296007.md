Many people around the globe do not wish to share their personal information online, especially their phone numbers. If privacy is a concern for you, it’s time to rejoice as we have unlocked a secret way to create a Gmail account without sharing your phone number. Excited to know it? Read on!

## Method 1: Using an Alternate Email Address

One of the easiest ways to create a Gmail account without sharing your phone number is by using an alternative email address. Follow the steps below to create your account:

1. Go to the Gmail Sign-up page.
2. Fill in your desired username and password.
3. Instead of filling in your phone number in the ‘phone number’ field, go to the ‘email address’ field.
4. Enter your alternate email address in the field.
5. Complete the rest of the registration process by clicking ‘Next’.

This method is simple, and it allows you to create a Gmail account without giving out your phone number.

## Method 2: Use a Temporary Phone Number

If you do not have an alternate email address, you can use a temporary phone number. Many websites offer temporary phone numbers for free or for a minimal fee. Follow the steps below to create your Gmail account with a temporary phone number:

1. Go to the Gmail Sign-up page.
2. Fill in your desired username and password.
3. Go to the ‘phone number’ field.

Using a temporary phone number is an excellent option, especially if you do not want to share your phone number. However, you should ensure that the website offering the temporary phone numbers is reliable and secure.

## Method 3: Use a Google Voice Number

If you do not want to use an alternate email address or a temporary phone number, you can use a Google Voice number. A Google Voice number is a phone number that you can use to make and receive calls, send text messages, and use voicemail. To create a Gmail account with a Google Voice number, follow the steps below:
