# Stop Annoying Telemarketers in Seconds - Learn How to Block Unwanted Calls Now!

Are you tired of receiving unsolicited calls from telemarketers? Do robocalls ruin your peaceful time at home or work? If so, it's time to put an end to these annoying calls once and for all. With the rise of automated calling systems and the growing number of companies using telemarketing techniques, it's becoming increasingly difficult to block them manually. But, there are several handy ways you can use to stop these pesky phone calls.

## Here are some of the ways you can block unwanted calls.

### Register on the Do Not Call Registry

The National Do Not Call Registry is a government-sponsored service that restricts unwanted telemarketing calls to your phone number. All you need to do is register your phone number with the registry, and they will add it to their database, which in turn will protect your phone number from unwanted calls from telemarketers. It's entirely free of charge, but your phone number must be a US phone number.

### Install a Mobile App or Use a Call Blocking Device

One of the most practical solutions to block unwanted calls is by installing a mobile app or using a call blocking device. Many phone manufacturers now come with this feature, but you can also get third-party apps or devices to do the job. Such devices include blocking services like NOMOROBO or call blockers like CPR V5000. These features and apps use call databases to recognize known spam and block them from your phone.

### Check your Phone Settings

Most smartphones have a built-in feature to block numbers for unwanted calls. If you're tired of telemarketers or scammers or if someone is harassing your phone number, you can block them from your phone's settings. Simply go to your phone app, click on the desired number or contact, and find the option to block them. From then on, you'll no longer receive any calls or text messages from that individual or company.

### Use Caller ID

An Caller ID feature comes with many phone carriers, which identifies incoming calls from unknown numbers or those who aren't on your contact list. If you don't recognize the number and suspect it's spam, don't pick it up! If it's important, the caller can leave a voicemail or send a text message.

### Report a Spam Call

Lastly, you can report any unwanted calls that find their way through to your phone number. Both the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) provide platforms for people to report spam calls. Reporting every spam call you receive will help authorities identify and eliminate the spammers responsible.

In conclusion, there are many ways to prevent annoying telemarketers from reaching your number. From mobile apps and call blocking devices to checking your phone settings, you can determine what works best to make your phone entirely spam-free. By following these tips, you can stay in control of your phone and ensure peace of mind.

It turns out that these unwanted calls, which include illegal and spoofed robocalls, are the FCC’s top consumer complaint and have taken top priority. This has led people to take action with tools/apps that enable call blocking technology.
So, if you want to put an end to those annoying, unwanted calls and potential scammers, call blocking is your best option. Here are a few tips on how to stop these calls in their tracks before they can even reach you.

 
## Block calls on your cellphone



Downloading a call blocking app is probably your best option for stopping unwanted calls on your cellphone. Think of a call blocking app like a filter.
The technology uses previously gathered information from users and other resources in order to distinguish between scam calls and legit calls. If you get a call that seems like a scam, the app will attempt to catch them before they ring through.
There are apps that will typically let you choose how to respond to calls that are identified as scams. Calls can be stopped, go straight to your voicemail, or go silent and not ring at all.
They can help you to block calls based on the area code and geographical origin of the caller as well. Certain apps give you the option to send prewritten texts to callers or even complaints directly to the FTC if you wish.
 
 
In some cases, you may not need to access the app store to find suitable call blocking tools. Most cell phones come with menu options that allow you to block calls from certain numbers, however, there might be a limit to how many numbers you can block.
Getting spam/scam calls while you’re at work or in a meeting can be even more annoying. Cell phones typically have features like ‘Do Not Disturb’, which allows you to set time parameters in which calls from specific or unknown numbers will automatically go straight to voicemail.

 
## Block calls on a landline



If you’re one of the few who still has a landline, no worries, there are ways for you to block unwanted calls, too. For traditional landlines that don’t work via the internet (VoIP), you can buy and install a separate call blocking device. The devices are usually small boxes that can be attached to your phone.
Some devices operate by utilizing blacklist databases of known scam numbers that have popped up across the grid, but they also let you add specific numbers that you may want to be blocked. Other devices strictly depend on you to create and update your own customized blacklist of numbers to block.
 
 
A few devices work by using the inverse method of blacklist call blocking, which is known as the whitelist, or filtering based on approved numbers of your choice. This helps you to limit which calls get through, or, much like your cell phone, lets you set up “do not disturb” hours during which calls go straight to voicemail.
There are even call blocking devices that work to identify robocalls by playing a prerecorded message prompting callers to press a number or take a specific action in order for the call to be continued.

 
## Block calls on an internet phone



If you have an internet or digital-based telephone, it’s possible you have VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) service on your home phone and don’t even know it. This means that your phone makes calls over the internet, instead of over the traditional phone lines. If you’re not sure how your calls are routed, you should check with your carrier.
Internet-based call blocking services are capable of blocking unwanted calls on phones that use the internet. Your carrier might be able to recommend a specific service. Or, you can do some digging yourself and search online for any expert and previous customer reviews.
Much like mobile apps available on mobile devices, some internet-based services require all calls to be routed through their service, where they are instantly analyzed and screened for any sign of illegitimacy.
You may have choices about how unwanted calls are handled. For example, unwanted calls can be set to ring silently, be routed to a separate voicemail, sent to a spam folder, or stopped altogether.
