# Unlock the Secrets to Secure Your Insta Account in 2022 - Learn How to Check & Remove Login Devices!

Instagram has become an important part of our lives, especially during the pandemic when remote communication has become the norm. With millions of users worldwide, it is essential to keep your Instagram account secure. In this article, we will discuss some essential tips and tricks to maintain the security of your Instagram account.

## Use Strong Passwords

The first and most crucial step to secure your Instagram account is to create a strong password. The password should be at least eight characters long, include letters, numbers, and special characters. You can also use a password manager to generate and store strong passwords.

## Enable Two-Factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring a code sent to your phone or email when signing in. To enable 2FA on your Instagram Account, go to your profile settings, tap on "Security," then "Two-Factor Authentication," and finally choose the preferred authentication method.

## Check Your Login Devices

Instagram allows you to check the devices that have accessed your account. If you noticed any unusual login devices, you can remove them. To check your login devices, go to your profile settings, then "Security," and finally "Login Activity." Here you can see a list of devices that have logged into your account. If any of them are unknown, remove them immediately to secure your account.

## Keep Your Instagram App Up to Date

Updating your Instagram app to the latest version is essential in keeping your account secure. Instagram routinely releases updates that patch security flaws and add new security features. Enable automatic updates on your device or regularly check the app store for new updates.

## Be Mindful of Third-Party Applications

As exciting as it may seem, using Instagram third-party applications can be risky. Third-party applications may require too much access to your Instagram account, including personal information or direct access to your account. Verify that the applications are secure before allowing them access to your Instagram account.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, keeping your Instagram account secure is crucial. By using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, checking your login devices, keeping your Instagram app up to date, and being mindful of third-party applications, you can protect your account and your digital footprint on Instagram. Apply these tips to your Instagram account, and you can be rest assured that your account is safe and secure.
