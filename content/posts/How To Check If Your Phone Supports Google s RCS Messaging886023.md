### What is RCS?


RCS is basically a huge upgrade over SMS. It is a protocol between mobile operators and phones. Initially, RCS was supposed to be deployed by the carriers themselves, in partnership with Google, on a phone-by-phone basis.
However, things didn’t work out pretty well, and then Google took things into its control and enabled RCS chats on phones regardless of the carrier.
Just like instant messaging apps, RCS relies on an internet data connection to send and receive messages. The only difference is that the RCS protocol is designed to replace the SMS and MMS.
If your phone supports RCS messaging, you don’t need to install any separate app to get the chat features.
