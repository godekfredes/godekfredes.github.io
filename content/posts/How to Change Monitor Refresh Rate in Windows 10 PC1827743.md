Are you looking to enhance your screen clarity and reduce motion blur on your Windows 10 PC? Look no further because we have the ultimate guide to changing monitor refresh rate like a pro! 

Firstly, let’s understand what monitor refresh rate is – it’s the number of times per second that a display refreshes its image. This is measured in hertz (Hz). A higher refresh rate means a smoother and more responsive display, which is ideal for gamers and those involved in graphic design, video editing, and other visual-intensive tasks.

Without further ado, here’s the guide to changing your monitor refresh rate on Windows 10:
 
Step 1: Check your monitor’s specifications
The first step is to check your monitor’s manufacturer website or user manual to know the maximum refresh rate supported by your monitor. Most modern monitors support a refresh rate of 60Hz or more. 

Step 2: Check your graphic card driver
Make sure that your graphic card driver is updated. This is important because an outdated driver might not support a higher refresh rate, which can cause problems or even damage your hardware. You can check your graphic card’s website to ensure that you have the latest driver installed.

Step 3: Access Display settings
Go to “Settings” and select “System.” From there, find and select “Display settings.” 

Step 4: Change the refresh rate
Under Display settings, find the “Display Adapter Properties” and select it. A new window will appear, and under the “Monitor” tab, select the drop-down box next to “Screen refresh rate.” Choose the refresh rate that you’d like to set and click “Apply” to confirm the changes. 

Step 5: Test your display
After setting the new refresh rate, test your display by playing a game or watching a video. You should notice a difference in the display’s smoothness and responsiveness.

In conclusion, changing monitor refresh rate on Windows 10 is easy when you follow these steps, and it can make a significant difference in the way you experience your PC. However, remember that if your hardware can’t handle a higher refresh rate, then you might encounter issues. So, make sure to follow the first step in this guide before proceeding with the rest. Enjoy your enhanced screen clarity and smooth display experience!

In short and simple words, the higher the refresh rate, the better will be the experience. On the other hand, a lower refresh rate usually results in screen flickering. Also, monitors with low refresh rates tend to cause eye strain and headaches.
Monitors with higher refresh rates also benefit gamers a lot. Using a higher screen refresh rate of 144Hz or even 240Hz will offer a much better gaming experience than 60Hz. Your PC is supposed to select the best refresh rate automatically. In most cases, you don’t need to make any changes to the monitor’s refresh rate. However, there could be times when you need to set the refresh rate manually.
