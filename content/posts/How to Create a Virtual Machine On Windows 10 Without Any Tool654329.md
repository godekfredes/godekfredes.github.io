## You won't believe how easy it is to create a virtual machine on Windows 10 without any tool!

Virtual machines have become an essential tool for developers, system administrators, and IT professionals. They enable you to run multiple operating systems on a single machine, isolate different environments, and test software in simulated environments. Creating a virtual machine, however, has often been a challenging task that requires specific tools and technical knowledge. But what if we told you that you could create a virtual machine on Windows 10 without any tool and with just a few clicks? 

Yes, you read that right! Windows 10 includes a built-in feature called Hyper-V that allows you to create and manage virtual machines without the need for any additional software or tools. The Hyper-V feature is available on Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions. If you have Windows 10 Home, you will need to upgrade to a higher version to use Hyper-V.

So, how can you create a virtual machine on Windows 10 with Hyper-V? Let's take a look at the steps:

### Step 1: Enable Hyper-V

The first step is to enable the Hyper-V feature on your Windows 10 computer. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click on the Windows Start button and type "Turn Windows features on or off" in the search box, then press Enter.

2. In the "Windows Features" window, scroll down to find "Hyper-V" and check the box next to it.

3. Click on "OK" to save the changes and wait for Windows to install Hyper-V.

4. Restart your computer to apply the changes.

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Machine

Once you have enabled Hyper-V, you can create a virtual machine with these easy steps:

1. Open the Hyper-V Manager by typing "Hyper-V Manager" in the Start menu search box and selecting it from the search results.

2. Click on "New" in the right panel of the Hyper-V Manager.

3. In the "New Virtual Machine Wizard" window, click "Next" to start the configuration process.

4. Choose a name and location for your virtual machine and click "Next."

5. Select the generation of the virtual machine. If you're not sure, select "Generation 1."

6. Allocate memory to your virtual machine. You can choose the amount of memory you want to allocate, but make sure it doesn't exceed the amount of RAM you have on your computer.

7. Configure the virtual hard disk. You can either create a new virtual hard disk or use an existing one. Choose the size and location of the virtual hard disk and click "Next."

8. Choose the installation media for your virtual machine. You can either use an ISO file, a physical DVD drive, or an existing virtual hard disk. Click "Next" when done.

9. Review your virtual machine settings and click "Finish" to create it.

### Step 3: Install an Operating System

After you have created your virtual machine, you need to install an operating system on it. Follow these steps:

1. Start your virtual machine by selecting it in the Hyper-V Manager and clicking "Start."

2. Choose the installation media for your operating system, whether it's an ISO file or a physical DVD drive.

3. Install the operating system as you would on a physical computer.

### Step 4: Configure the Virtual Machine

Congratulations, you have created your virtual machine on Windows 10 without any tool! Now you can configure it as needed by installing applications, updating drivers, or customizing settings.

To make changes to your virtual machine, select it in the Hyper-V Manager and click on "Settings." From there, you can modify the configuration of your virtual machine, including its memory, add virtual devices, and configure network settings.

Creating a virtual machine on Windows 10 with Hyper-V is a straightforward process that only requires a few clicks. So why not take advantage of this built-in feature to run multiple operating systems on your computer and test software in simulated environments? Give it a try, and you won't believe how easy it is!

In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a given computer system. Virtual machines operate based on the architecture of equipment and functions of a real or hypothetical computer, and their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.
In Windows Operating System, users use lots of third-party tools that play virtual Operating System on their devices, but the official tool that you can use is Hyper- V this is the best virtual machine for windows 10. And with the help of this tool, you can host various OS virtually right on your OS. And in this guide, we will tell you the way by which you can quickly create a virtual machine.

## What is a virtual machine?


Well, Virtualization is when you take one set of physical resources like RAM, hard drive space, CPU and allocate them into one separate system. Since you have created a separate partition within a Windows operating system, it can’t be termed as a ‘real’ system. So, its termed as ‘Virtual’ machines which run inside the operating system.

 
### Benefits of the virtual machine


Now you all might be wondering what’s the role of the Virtual machine and what it serves? Well, it serves for some great purpose and we have listed some practical ways to use a virtual machine.

 

New Operating System
With the Virtual machine, you can enjoy two different OS at the same computer. For example, if your computer is running on a Windows operating system, but you also want to experience Linux, then you can install and operate Linux on the virtual machine.
Running Old/Incompatible Software
If you are using Ubuntu, then you might be well aware of the fact that Ubuntu can’t run Windows apps. Well, there are some tools available for Ubuntu that allows users to emulate Windows apps, but still, it fails to deliver the original feel. In this scenario, you can install Windows 7 on a Virtual machine and can run Windows apps. Similarly, you can also run incompatible tools on Virtual Machine by creating an older version of windows virtual pc.
Open Suspicious Files
In simple words, on a virtual machine, you can do stuff that you generally should avoid. For instance, security experts recommend that you should never open any unknown email attachments. So, in this scenario, a virtual machine can be a great way to examine skeptical files. The good thing is that even if the attachment raises any security issues, it will only play with the Virtual Machine.
Develop Apps For Other Platforms
Usually, app developers use virtual machines to test their new apps before publishing it to different platforms. Since Virtual machines allow users to run multiple OS on a single computer, you can test your apps on different platforms. These things just make things easier.
