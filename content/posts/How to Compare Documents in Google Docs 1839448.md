In Summary


Google Docs is a popular word processor for all your writing needs.
If you use it to write essays, scripts, and assignments or to collaborate with others, there will be times when you might end up with two similar documents.
For such situations, Google offers the Compare Documents feature in Google Docs, which lets you compare two documents to spot the differences between them or identify the duplicate.







Fortunately, Google has a feature in Docs to help you in such situations. It’s called Compare Documents, and it lets you compare two Docs documents to track the changes made to them over time and the name of the person who made them.
Follow along as we guide you through the steps to use the Compare Documents feature to compare documents in Google Docs.

 
## How to Compare Two Documents in Google Docs Using Compare Documents


Google Docs’ Compare Documents feature works with two documents. As such, you need to choose two documents. The first document you choose serves as the base document, while the second one serves as the reference document.
Follow these steps to use Compare Documents to compare two Docs documents:

 

Go to Google Docs and log in to your account.
Open one of the documents you want to compare. This will be the base document for your comparison.
Click on Tools in the Docs toolbar and select Compare Documents. If the button is grayed out, make sure both your documents are Google Docs documents.

In the Compare Documents dialog box, tap the selection box under Select the comparison document and choose the other document, i.e., the document against which you want to compare the base document you chose earlier.

Click on the Attribute differences text box and enter the name of the user who will be labeled as the author of the edits in the comparison file you’re about to create.
Hit Compare.




Wait for a few seconds for Google Docs to process both documents. When done, you’ll see a dialog box that says Comparison is ready. Click Open in this box, and a new comparison document will open in a new browser tab with a title that starts with “Comparison of” followed by the name of both your documents.
In this comparison report, you’ll see all differences between the two documents highlighted in maroon using strikethroughs. Look to the right; there will be a sidebar with all the edits made to the document since its creation.

On each suggestion, you’ll see two options: Accept Suggestion and Reject Suggestion. If you like an edit suggestion, click on Accept Suggestion next to it, and the edit will be applied to your document. On the other hand, if you feel an edit suggestion isn’t worth adding, hit Reject Suggestion to remove it.
Additionally, if you want to comment on a suggestion, click on it, enter your message in the comment, and hit Reply. Or, to invite other people to check out a suggestion, simply tag the user by typing their name, like this @username, and hit Reply.
