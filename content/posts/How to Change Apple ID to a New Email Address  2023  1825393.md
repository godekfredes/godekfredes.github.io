Whatever your reason may be, switching your Apple ID email address is a straightforward process that you can complete in a matter of minutes. 

In this article, we'll walk you through the process of switching your Apple ID email address.

Step 1: Check if the new email address is available 

The first step is to make sure that the email address you want to switch to is available. You can check the availability of the email address by creating a new email account with your desired email provider. If the email address is available, you can move on to step two.

Step 2: Sign in to your Apple ID account page 

Next, sign in to your Apple ID account page with your current Apple ID email address and password.

Once you're signed in, navigate to the "Edit" section of your account by clicking on your name at the top of the page and selecting "Edit" from the dropdown menu.

Step 5: Add the new email address 

You'll see a field labeled "Email Address." Enter your new email address here.

Step 6: Verify the new email address 

After entering your new email address, you'll need to verify it. Apple will send a verification email to your new email address. Follow the instructions in the email to verify your new email address.

Step 7: Set your new email address as the primary email address 

Once your new email address is verified, navigate back to the "Edit" section of your account. Click on the "Edit" button next to the "Apple ID and Primary Email Address" section again. This time, select the new email address as your primary email address and click "Save."

That's it! Your Apple ID email address has now been switched to your new email address.

Before you change your Apple ID to a new email address, here are a few points to remember:

 

If you’re trying to change your Apple ID email address to an @icloud.com one that you’ve created in the last 30 days, then try changing your Apple ID after 30 days.
When trying to change your Apple ID, if you see a message that tells you that the email address you’re trying to use isn’t available or is in use, make sure you or any of your family members aren’t already using it.
If you’re already using an Apple domain Apple ID—the ones with the @iCloud.com, @me.com, or @mac.com address—you can’t switch back to third-party email addresses.

## Switching to a New Apple ID Email Address is Hassle-Free


Over the years, Apple has made it really easy to change your Apple ID email address. So, if you’ve got a new email address or lost access to an existing one, which also happens to be linked to your Apple ID, you can easily switch to the new email address and keep using Apple devices and services.
When you change your Apple ID email address, you don’t lose your contacts, purchases, and other account information, contrary to what some people believe. But it’s always a good practice to backup your device and its data, so you don’t lose your important data if something goes wrong.
To reiterate, Apple lets you change your Apple ID if it's from:

 

a third-party email service to another third-party email service
a third-party service to any of the Apple domain ones (@iCloud.com, @me.com, or @mac.com address)



Tap Settings > [your name] > Password & Security > Change Password.
You would need to enter your current password or device passcode, then enter the new password of your choice and confirm the new password.
Click on the Apple menu () > System Preferences > Apple ID > Password & Security > Change Password.
You will be asked to enter the password you used to unlock the Mac before the new password is set.

 

Sign in to appleid.apple.com
Click Password in the Sign-In and Security section
Enter the current password and your new password, and confirm the new password to change it.

 

On your iPhone or iPad, open the Settings app
Tap General
Under Language & Region, select desired country from the list under Region
Enter new info and tap the Save Changes button on the bottom right corner
