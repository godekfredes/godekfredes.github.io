# Revolutionize Your Whatsapp Game in 2022: Learn the Ultimate Image Cropping and Resizing Hack!

If you're an avid Whatsapp user, you probably know that sending images can be a bit frustrating. The app automatically compresses the images to save space and data, which often leads to poor quality pictures. Fortunately, there's a way to improve the quality of your images while keeping them small and easy to send. 

Here's how to revolutionize your Whatsapp game in 2022 with the ultimate image cropping and resizing hack: 

## Step 1: Download a photo editing app

To start, you'll need a photo editing app that allows you to crop and resize images. There are plenty of apps available for both Android and iOS devices, such as Adobe Lightroom, Snapseed, and Canva. Choose one that suits your needs and preferences, and install it on your phone. 

## Step 2: Choose the right aspect ratio

Before you start cropping your images, you need to select the right aspect ratio. This will ensure that your images fit perfectly on Whatsapp without getting cut off or distorted. The ideal aspect ratio for Whatsapp images is 9:16, which means the height should be 1.77 times the width. 

Most photo editing apps have preset aspect ratios that you can choose from. Look for the 9:16 option, and use it as your template for cropping your images. 

## Step 3: Crop your images

Now that you have the right aspect ratio, it's time to crop your images. Open the photo editing app and select the image you want to send on Whatsapp. Use the cropping tool to resize your image to fit the 9:16 aspect ratio. 

Make sure to focus on the most important part of the image when cropping, whether it's a person's face, a landscape, or a specific object. You want to capture the essence of the image while still making it easy to send on Whatsapp. 

## Step 4: Resize your images

Once you've cropped your image, you need to resize it to make it smaller without losing quality. This will make it easier to send on Whatsapp without compromising on the image's clarity. 

Most photo editing apps have a resize tool that allows you to adjust the image's dimensions. Use this tool to resize your image to a maximum width of 720 pixels. This is the ideal size for Whatsapp images, as it prevents the app from compressing your images too much. 

## Step 5: Save and send your images

Once you've cropped and resized your image, save it to your camera roll or gallery. You can now send it on Whatsapp without worrying about poor quality or compression issues. 

With the ultimate image cropping and resizing hack, you can revolutionize your Whatsapp game and send high-quality images without any fuss. Try it out today and see the difference it makes in your messaging experience!
