With Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, Google introduced a beautiful new sans-serif based typeface family — Roboto. Since then, the company has been constantly tweaking the font typeface with every new version of Android.
However, Roboto might not be to everyone’s liking and there definitely are many fonts out there that are much more beautiful than Roboto.

Thankfully, changing fonts in Android is no rocket science and only requires a few taps, provided you have root access. Below is a quick guide on how you can change fonts on your Android device effortlessly -:
Step 1: Head over to the Play Store and download iFont. The app is free to download and only requires root access to work properly.
Step 2: Start the app and grant it root access. By default, iFont shows you all the fonts present in its database sorted via different categories. Due to this, you might not find all the popular fonts in the iFont library because of copyright issues.
If you have managed to get hands on your favorite FTF files of your font, just copy them to the ‘ifont’ folder inside the sdcard of your Android device. Skip directly to step 4 now.

Step 3: Select the font you want to install on your Android device from the iFont library. When you first select a font, you will be shown a small preview of how the font will look as well. If you like the preview, tap the ‘Download’ button and click on ‘Install’ once the download is completed.
You will be prompted to reboot your Android device for the font changes to take effect.

Step 4: If you want to install a locally saved font, tap on the ‘Local’ tab on the top left. The app will display all the fonts found on your device. Simply tap the font you want to install and then click on ‘Use’.
If you are prompted to select the font type, make sure to select the one corresponding to the language you use on your Android device. Once installed, make sure to reboot your device for the changes to take effect.
Do keep in mind that not all fonts are going to look good on your Android device and some fonts might introduce rendering issues. Keep playing around with different fonts until you find something that suits your taste and works flawlessly as well.
Android devices from Samsung and LG already come with an inbuilt font manager, which even allows you to install fonts directly from the Play Store without any hackery. Just head over to Settings -> Display to change the font on your device.
