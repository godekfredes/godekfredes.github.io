Are you struggling to achieve high scores in your favorite Android Lollipop games? Do you wish you could have unlimited points and boost your gaming experience? Well, here’s a secret cheat trick that can help you unlock unlimited points in your favorite Android Lollipop games! 

The first thing you need to do is to install a game-hacking app on your Android Lollipop device. There are several game-hacking apps available on the internet, but not all of them work effectively. The best game-hacking app you can use to unlock unlimited points in Android Lollipop games is Game Killer.

2. Click on the “Hack” button to initiate the hacking process. 

3. Enter the score or points you want to have, and then click “OK.” 

4. Play the game and you will notice that your score has increased significantly beyond the usual limit. 

It is important to note that using a game-hacking app like Game Killer is considered cheating and may hamper your gaming experience. Some game developers have strict policies against cheating and may ban your account or device if you're caught using a hacking tool. Therefore, it is advisable to use this trick only when you’re stuck or cannot progress in a game. 

In conclusion, unlocking unlimited points in your favorite Android Lollipop games is now easier than ever with the Game Killer cheating tool. With this app, you can modify your scores to your advantage and gain an upper hand in challenging games. However, it’s important to use this trick wisely, as excessive cheating may ruin the fun and challenge of gaming.

In the current version, the Android Lollipop, the inspiration was the addictive little game Flappy Bird, which puts the player in charge of a bird that must dodge some pipes while accumulating points.
In this adaptation, the search giant changed the beautiful little robot bird green and placed Lollipops instead of pipes.

The game will present as slow animations lollipops that were your main obstacles, will not move from mere distractions. With this little trick, it’s easy to get dozens of points without worrying too much and just giving subtle hints on the screen.
