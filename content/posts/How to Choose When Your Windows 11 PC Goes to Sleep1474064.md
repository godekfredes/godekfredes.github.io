For example, you can set a shorter sleep timer for the battery mode as compared to the plugged-in mode. This way, you can conserve more battery power and get more mileage out of your Windows 11 PC.

c) Enable Hibernate mode:
Windows 11 also offers a Hibernate mode, which saves the current state of your PC to the hard drive and shuts it down. This way, you can resume your PC from where you left off without having to go through the boot-up process. By enabling Hibernate mode, you can conserve more power and unlock the hidden power of your Windows 11 PC.
