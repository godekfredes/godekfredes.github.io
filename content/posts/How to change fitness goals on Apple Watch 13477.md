Uncover the Hidden Apple Watch Hack: Revolutionize Your Fitness Game with New Goal Settings!

If you own an Apple Watch, you already know the powerful impact it can have on your daily routine. From tracking your steps and calories burned to monitoring your heart rate, the Apple Watch is a game-changing tool for improving your overall health and wellness. But did you know that there is a hidden hack that can take your fitness game to the next level? Enter the new goal settings feature.

In the latest update to the Apple Watch’s operating system, users now have the ability to set weekly fitness goals tailored to their personal preferences and habits. This feature is located in the Activity app on your watch and allows you to establish specific metrics for your daily movement, exercise, and standing goals. Whether you want to increase your daily step count, improve your cardiovascular endurance, or simply make an effort to stand up and move more throughout the day, the goal settings feature can help you get there.

So, how do you start using this game-changing hack? Here’s a step-by-step guide:

Step 1: Open the Activity app on your Apple Watch.

Step 2: Scroll down to the “Goals” section.

Step 3: Choose the goal you want to set by tapping on it. You can set goals for your daily movement, exercise, and standing.

Step 4: Use the plus and minus buttons to establish your desired daily goal. For example, you might set a goal to walk 10,000 steps each day or to complete 30 minutes of exercise.

Step 5: Tap “Set” to save your new goal.

Once your goal is set, your Apple Watch will keep track of your progress throughout the week and provide real-time updates on how close you are to achieving your target. You can view your progress by opening the Activity app on your watch and scrolling down to the “Goals” section. There, you’ll see a visual representation of your progress, as well as the total number of days you’ve met your daily goal.

Using the new goal settings feature is a powerful way to stay motivated and accountable on your fitness journey. By setting specific, achievable goals for yourself, you’ll be more likely to stay on track and push yourself to reach new heights. Plus, seeing your progress in real-time can be incredibly rewarding and inspire you to keep pushing towards your goals.

In conclusion, the Apple Watch is a game-changing tool for improving your health and wellness. With the new goal settings feature, you can take your fitness game to the next level and achieve your personal goals faster than ever before. So what are you waiting for?

If you're an Apple Fitness user, your day revolves around meeting your Watch's demanding requirements for activity. In that sense, it's a lot like a little dog -- always demanding more activity. In Apple Fitness parlance, it's all about closing your rings.
There are three rings:

 
Movement: Measures your overall activity throughout the day. Workout: Measures the time and intensity of your workouts. Stand: Measures how often you get up off your duff and move around. 


When you get your Apple Watch, movement defaults to about 500 calories, Workout requires 30 minutes, and Stand requires 12 stands across 12 hours. Initially, you could only modify the Movement calorie value. But that changed in a recent iOS release, and now you can set your goals for all three.

Do this by loading the Activity app on your Watch:
You'll see your three rings for the day. It's after midnight as I write this, so I haven't recorded much activity yet.

Flick your finger up on the Apple Watch face until you see the Change Goals menu. 
Tap it once, and you'll be shown your Movement fitness goals (Movement is red).

Tap the plus or minus buttons to choose your burn rate. If you're not sure what goal to set, check with your doctor or your trainer. Then, press Next. You'll see the green Workout goal: 
I like to do 30 minutes, but I don't always do it all at once. Sometimes I use workout times to break up my day. Sometimes I do different kinds of workouts. But 30 minutes a day is a good goal for me. Again, check with a medical professional to understand what numbers you should choose. 
Finally, let's set the Stand setting. Click next to move to the cyan settings screen. 
As with Movement and Workout, tap plus or minus to change the number of hours where you must stand. Remember, stand requires you to stand once an hour for the number of hours you specify. 
And that's it. Tap OK, and you've changed your fitness goals. Now, go out there and make yourself proud.
