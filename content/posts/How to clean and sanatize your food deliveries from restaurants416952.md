Exposed: Shocking Truths About How Restaurants Neglect Food Hygiene - Discover The Ultimate Guide To Safely Cleaning And Sanitizing Your Food Deliveries!

Are you one of those people who love to order food deliveries at home? Are you aware of the risks you face when you eat food from a restaurant without ensuring proper hygiene? If not, then you need to read this article and discover the shocking truths about how restaurants neglect food hygiene.

Food hygiene is crucial, regardless of whether you are a food lover or not. In recent years, there have been several reports about people getting sick due to contaminated food. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one in six Americans gets sick every year from foodborne diseases. The most common causes of foodborne illness are bacteria, viruses, and parasites.

Restaurants and food establishments have a responsibility to ensure that the food they serve is safe and hygienic. However, many fail to do so, exposing their customers to health risks. Here are some of the shocking truths about how restaurants neglect food hygiene:

1. Cross-Contamination: Cross-contamination is the transfer of harmful bacteria from one food item to another. This can happen when food is prepared on contaminated surfaces or with contaminated equipment. Restaurants often fail to clean and sanitize their surfaces and equipment, leading to cross-contamination.

2. Improper Storage: Food must be stored at the correct temperature to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria. However, many restaurants fail to do so, storing food at temperatures that are too high or too low. This can cause the food to spoil or become contaminated.

3. Poor Personal Hygiene: Restaurant staff must maintain personal hygiene to prevent the spread of germs. However, many fail to do so, contaminating food with their hands, hair, or clothing.

So, how can you ensure that the food you order is safe and hygienic? Here is an ultimate guide to safely cleaning and sanitizing your food deliveries.

1. Check the Ratings: Before ordering food from a restaurant, check their ratings on health and safety websites. You can also check their inspection reports.

2. Clean and Sanitize: When you receive your food delivery, clean and sanitize the packaging before opening it. Wipe down the containers with a sanitizing solution, such as a mixture of water and bleach.

3. Reheat: Reheat the food to the correct temperature to kill any harmful bacteria.

4. Wash Your Hands: Wash your hands before and after handling the food and packaging.

5. Dispose of the Packaging: Dispose of the packaging in the trash, and wash your hands again.

In conclusion, food hygiene is crucial for your health and safety. Restaurateurs must understand their responsibility and ensure that the food they serve is safe and hygienic. As a consumer, it is your responsibility to take measures to ensure that the food you order is safe to eat. Follow the ultimate guide to safely cleaning and sanitizing your food deliveries, and stay safe!

We’ve learned how tough the coronavirus really is in the wild. Not only can asymptomatic people easily transmit the virus, but its particles can survive on surfaces for up to 17 days. Tap or click here to find out more.
While you can let some packages sit outside until they’re safe to bring in, some items, like fresh produce, meal kits and meal deliveries, can’t be kept outdoors. How can you wash the germs away from your fresh deliveries?

 
## Closed restaurants, open spread of germs


Many restaurants have shuttered their dining rooms in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. But just because there’s nowhere to sit doesn’t mean the kitchens are shut down. 
To keep money flowing, dining establishments across America are switching to delivery and carry-out options only. While this might sound good in theory, it does present some unique issues for social distancing and the spread of disease.
For starters, many restaurants have dangerously small takeout areas that can facilitate the spread of germs. Delivery drivers from platforms like Uber Eats and Grubhub will likely be visiting the same open restaurants, and people-gathering can lead to transmission.
In the March 20 episode of The Kim Komando Show, driver and blogger Sergio Avedian reported seeing a crowd of delivery drivers form near the counter of one restaurant and nobody seemed to be observing the six-foot space minimum required for social distancing.
And with more drivers on the job than ever, that means even more vectors for infection. There’s no way of knowing whether your delivery person is an asymptomatic carrier or not, so it’s up to us to sanitize our deliveries before bringing them inside our homes.

 
## How to clean food delivery before bringing it indoors


There are genuine fears about whether COVID-19 can be transmitted through food, but the CDC says not to worry. That said, packaging is still a real vector for infection and health officials are urging people to clean and disinfect items as much as possible.
Since we’re not scientists or medical professionals, treat the following more as trusted advice than peer-reviewed data. If any of these germ-fighting steps make you uneasy, you might want to sit out ordering food. 
These are some of the recommended steps you should take for any restaurant delivery you order:

 
When ordering food, ask if the restaurant or service offers a “touch-free” delivery option. This means the driver will leave your food at your doorstep and leave without you needing to interact with them. Should you choose this option, make sure to tip in your delivery app or with the cashier over the phone.When you receive your food, wear gloves and wipe any packaging with disinfecting wipes. Make sure you’re using disinfectants that are FDA approved and known to kill the coronavirus. Tap or click here to see an updated list.Bring the food inside and avoid setting the packaging down on tables or countertops. Use your own kitchen utensils to transfer the food to a clean plate or bowl and and immediately throw the box away.Make sure to also throw away any napkins, plastic bags or plastic utensils included with your meal. Better yet, when you place your order, ask that they don’t include utensils or napkins.Wash your hands thoroughly with soap for 20 seconds in warm water, then sanitize the edges and bottom of the plate you’ll be eating off of with disinfecting wipes. Avoid touching the food with these wipes.Grab a clean fork, knife or spoon and dig in.


As a basic precaution, only eat your freshly delivered food with utensils, not your hands. Health officials also discourage putting your hands near your face, as it’s one of the most common ways to infect yourself.
Our advice? Make your own food, in your own controlled environment. Plus, cooking at high temperature is known to kill viruses and bacteria like salmonella.

 
## Bonus: Nuke the flu!


If you want even more peace of mind, you can take the extra steps of putting your food in the refrigerator once its moved to a plate and then microwaving it hot again.
The CDC recognizes that microwave cooking can disinfect food, but notes that the item must be warm throughout. If you reheat your food, make sure to stir it and evenly distribute heat before enjoying.
These steps may seem obsessive-compulsive or over-the-top, but every hygiene effort you make goes toward the goal of flattening the curve of infection. We can’t be too sure when this pandemic will end, but we can make small choices in our daily lives to bring it to a close much sooner. Bon appétit!
