Say Goodbye to Relentless Hulu Ads - 5 Genius Hacks to Block Them in 2021!

Are you tired of being interrupted by endless commercials every time you're watching your favorite show on Hulu? You're not alone! Hulu's ad-supported platform is great for those who don't want to pay extra for ad-free access. Still, it can be a real nuisance for people who don't like to be bothered by constant commercials. Luckily, several hacks can help get rid of Hulu ads. In this article, we'll go over five ways to block those relentless Hulu ads.

1. Upgrade to Hulu (No Ads) Plan

The easiest solution to stop ads on Hulu is to upgrade to the "No Ads" plan. It's the most efficient way of stopping the ads since you won't encounter them anymore. It means paying more money, but it's worth it if you're fed up with the ads ruining your streaming experience.

2. Use Ad-Blocking Software

Ad-blockers are available as software extensions for many web browsers, including Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari. If you use one of these browsers, install the Adblock Plus or uBlock Origin extension, which will block Hulu ads automatically. However, it's worth mentioning that Hulu is continuously updating its ad technology to avoid getting blocked; using this hack might not work in the long run.

3. Rewind the Show You're Watching

If you're uncomfortable with ad-blockers and don't feel like paying extra for Hulu's No Ads plan, this is the hack for you. Rewind the show you're watching by 10-15 seconds as soon as the commercials begin. Once it resumes playing, you should be able to enjoy the rest of the episode/commercial-free.

4. Download Ad-Skipping Apps

Various ad-skipping apps are available that can automatically scan commercials in a Hulu show and fast-forward, skip or mute them until it gives you back your show. One example is AdSkip, which is specifically designed to remove Hulu ads automatically.

5. Clear Cache and Cookies

Your browser cache and saved cookies can sometimes prevent or reduce the efficiency of ad-blockers. Clearing your cache regularly and deleting saved Hulu cookies can help by disrupting the website's ability to track your viewing history and disable the ad-blocker.

Conclusion

In conclusion, while ads support Hulu, they can be more of a nuisance than a benefit to users. With these hacks, you don't have to throw in the towel just yet. You can enjoy your favorite shows ad-free without having to switch from Hulu to other streaming rival apps. It's up to you which hack you choose, depending on what suits you best, but the hacks above remain practical and highly recommended if you want to say goodbye to those relentless Hulu ads.

For those who don’t know, Hulu is an online platform for streaming new and classic shows as well as live TV on nearly every medium. It’s one of the top choices amongst video streamers. However, just like Netflix, Hulu is also a premium service.
The premium plan of Hulu starts at $5.99 a month, and the Live TV option is priced at $64.99 a month. What’s worst is that even the basic plan of Hulu shows ads. Sometimes, the ads were 2-3 minutes long, interrupting the video experience.

So, if you want to watch videos without any interruption, you should first eliminate the ads. In this article, we will share some of the best methods to block Hulu ads in 2021. Let’s check out.

 
### 1. Using Chrome Extension

### 2. Use Two Hulu Tabs


Video streamers often rely on this trick to get rid of ads. Although the scheme might not work every time, it’s still worth a try. Follow some of the simple steps given below to Skip Hulu Ads.


 

Open Hulu on your web browser and select a video that you want to stream.
Now right click on the current tab card, and select ‘Duplicate.’
Now you will have two tabs streaming the same content.
Just mute the volume on the 2nd tab, and fast forward to a few seconds before the first ad (Ads were marked with a different color in the stream bar)
Now open the 1st tab and stream the video.
Now whenever the 1st commercial appears, switch to the second tab and watch the video there.



That’s it! You are done. It would be best if you repeated the trick between the ads. The only drawback is that it will increase your internet consumption.

 
### 3. Setup AdGuard DNS


For those who don’t know, AdGuard DNS is a foolproof way to block ads on Windows 10. Regardless of the apps you are using, AdGuard DNS filters out the ads, trackers, and analytic system.

Setting up AdGuard DNS might be complicated, but it will eliminate ads everywhere, including apps, browsers, games, websites, etc. We have already shared a detailed guide on how to set up AdGuard DNS on Windows 10. Make sure to check out that article.

 
### 4. Reload Hulu Frequently


Reloading the Hulu page won’t remove the ads, but it will replace the long ads with shorter ones. Whenever you come across a long-duration ad, refresh the streaming tab. After the refresh, you will notice faster ads.
What’s handy is that Hulu resumes the media playback at the point where you have left off. However, the trick doesn’t work every time.

 
### 5. Purchase the Hulu (No Ads) account



The premium plan that starts at $11.99 a month is entirely ad-free. The list might look expensive, but it’s worth it as it removes long ads from your Hulu account. Also, the Download & Watch feature is unlocked in that plan.
However, the add-ons remain the same for the base plan and the Hulu No-ads plan.
