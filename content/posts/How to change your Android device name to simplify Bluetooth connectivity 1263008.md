# Revolutionize Bluetooth Connection: Change Your Android Device Name with this Simple Trick!

If you frequently use Bluetooth to connect your Android device to other devices, you must have noticed that the default device name is bland and boring. Not to mention, it becomes confusing when you want to connect to multiple devices simultaneously. However, did you know that you can change your device name easily? This small trick can completely revolutionize the way you use Bluetooth on your Android device.

Here's how to change the name of your Android device for a seamless and efficient Bluetooth connection:

Step 1: Go to the Settings menu on your Android device

Step 2: Scroll down and tap on "About Phone" or "About Tablet"

Step 3: On the next screen, tap on "Device Name" or "Phone Name"

Step 4: Enter the new name you want to give your device and tap on "OK"

That's it! Your Android device will now be displayed with the new name whenever you turn on Bluetooth to connect with other devices.

By changing your device name, you can quickly identify which device you're connecting to, especially if you use multiple devices simultaneously. It can also make it easier for others to locate your device when they're trying to connect to it.

One crucial factor to consider when changing your device name is to use a name that won't give away any personal information. It's best to use a generic name that doesn't reveal your identity or location to protect your privacy.

In addition to a better Bluetooth connection experience, changing your device name can also make your device stand out from the crowd. You can choose a fun nickname or a unique name that reflects your personality instead of the generic device name that everyone else is using.

In conclusion, changing the name of your Android device is a simple yet effective trick to revolutionize your Bluetooth connection experience. It's a small tweak that can make a big difference and provide a seamless and efficient connection between your Android device and other devices. So, go ahead and try it out today!

This isn't a deal-breaking issue. And even if you attempt to connect to the wrong phone, you can always start over and connect to the other. But waitâ€¦if both phones have the same Bluetooth name, how will you know which is "the other" phone? You might not know.
Let's solve that simple problem, so you can simplify Bluetooth connectivity.

 
## Requirements


The only thing you'll need is an Android phone. It doesn't matter what phone you use or which version of Android you are using. Unless you purchased your phone years ago, most likely you're running at least version 10 or 11 of the OS, so the process should be the same or similar. I'll demonstrate this on a Pixel 7 running Android 13.

## How to change the Android device Bluetooth name
 
## A bit of advice on renaming your phone


I tend to be a bit paranoid about my privacy. Because of that, I'm not about to give my phone my full name. Why? When you're out in public you never know if someone is trying to hack your device via Bluetooth. Because of that, I'm not going to make it easier for someone to target me by giving my phone my name. Instead, I'll give my phone some random name or a number to prevent anyone from knowing which phone belongs to me. I will know which phone the name belongs to but no one else will. I'll even go so far as to change the name every now and then.
But that's all there is to rename your Android phone for simpler Bluetooth connectivity. Use a bit of caution with this feature and it will serve you well.
