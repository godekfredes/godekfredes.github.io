Title: You'll Never Believe How Easy It Is To Keep Your Inbox Organized With These Thunderbird Message Filters!

Introduction:
Are you tired of constantly scrolling through your inbox searching for important emails? Do you find yourself drowning in email clutter, unable to navigate your inbox efficiently? Worry not! Thunderbird, the free and open-source email client, offers an easy solution to this problem - Message Filters.

Body:
Thunderbird message filters, also known as Rules, automatically sort incoming emails into specific folders based on criteria you set. This saves time and ensures that important emails are not overlooked amidst the clutter. Here are some useful Thunderbird message filters to help keep your inbox organized:

1. Filter by sender: If you receive a lot of emails from a specific sender, you can create a filter to automatically move all emails from that sender to a designated folder. To do this, right-click on an email from the sender, select "Create filter from" and choose the criteria such as sender email address or domain.

2. Filter by subject line: You can also create filters based on subject lines. For example, if you receive a lot of promotional emails, you can set up a filter to automatically move them to a "Promotions" folder. This helps keep your main inbox free from clutter.

3. Filter by keywords: If you are waiting for an email with specific keywords in the subject line or body, Thunderbird can filter them automatically. You can create a filter with specific keywords that will be moved to a designated folder upon arrival.

4. Filter by attachment type: If you work in an industry where you receive a lot of attachments, Thunderbird can help by sorting them for you. You can create a filter that automatically moves emails with specific attachment types, such as PDFs or image files, to a designated folder.

Conclusion:
Thunderbird message filters are a simple yet powerful tool that helps in keeping your inbox organized. By setting criteria for filtering emails, you can save time finding important emails and keep your inbox clutter-free. Try these filters today and experience the ease of efficient email management.

It becomes pretty tedious to keep clean. 
That's one of the many reasons why I use the Thunderbird email client. With a simple-to-use GUI, I can create specific filters for incoming emails to send those emails to certain folders. This feature is automated and works every time the client pulls mail from the server. Create enough filters and you can keep that main inbox considerably cleaner.

## How to create message filters in Thunderbird to keep your inbox organized


So, if a full inbox gives you hives, this feature is right up your alley. Let me show you how to create a filter in Thunderbird.

Action: What to do with the messageLocation: Where to save the message


From the left drop-down, you can configure the filter to do things like move, copy, forward, mark as read, tag messages, and more. From the right drop-down, you select the folder that will house the message. You can also click + to add another action. 
For example, your first action might copy the email to a specific folder and the second moves it to a different folder. This would be a great way to have a backup of all emails that come in from a specific contact and then keep those emails housed in their own folder.
There are other options to choose from when creating your filter. You can specify how the filter is to be applied, filter before or after junk classification, and specify the exactness of the filter (should it match all of the criteria or any of the criteria). 
Once you've configured the fitter to your specifications, click OK to save it. Thunderbird will automatically start applying the filter as mail comes in.
That's it, you've created your first Thunderbird mail filter. Keep creating new ones and your inbox will finally be clean enough to manage. Just remember, however, there's probably unread emails in those destination folders… don't forget to check 'em.
