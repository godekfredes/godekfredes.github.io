While many users use Reddit from the web browser, its official app is available for Android and iOS. With mobile apps, you can enjoy all text-based discussion websites’ features.
Not many would know, but the Reddit mobile app also has a feature that lets you change the app’s color theme. We are not talking about the Dark and Light modes here; we are talking about the color themes in the Light mode.
