Android Users Beware: Your Device Could Be Infected! Learn How to Boot in Safe Mode Now to Protect Yourself!

As an Android user, you might encounter several security issues ranging from cyberattacks to malware infections. These issues can occur due to various reasons such as a lack of proper security measures, outdated software, or downloading files from untrusted sources. Therefore, it's important to understand the warning signs of such problems and take necessary steps to protect yourself.

One of the best ways to keep your device safe is to boot it in safe mode. Safe mode booting prevents any third-party applications from running, thus, allowing only the essential system applications to function. This can help identify if any particular app or program is causing any issues or if your device is infected.

If you're experiencing any of the following issues on your Android device, you might want to consider starting in safe mode:

● Your device is running much slower than usual
● Your battery is draining much faster than normal
● You're getting random pop-ups or ads
● Your device is frequently freezing or crashing
● You're experiencing unauthorized charges in your bank account

Here's how to boot your Android device in safe mode:

1. Hold down the "Power" button on your Android device until the "Power Off" menu appears.
2. Tap and hold the "Power Off" button on the menu until the "Reboot to Safe Mode" prompt appears.
3. Tap "OK" to confirm and your device will restart in Safe Mode.

Once your device boots in safe mode, take note of any improvement in its performance, battery life or any other issues. This will help you determine if there's any particular app or program causing the problem. You can then uninstall the program or clear the cache and data to resolve the issue.

In conclusion, Android devices are vulnerable to several security issues, and it's essential to take precautions to keep them safe. Booting in safe mode can be a quick and efficient way to help diagnose any potential issues while protecting your device from further damage. Be sure to keep in mind the warning signs of potential security concerns and perform regular maintenance by regularly updating your device and avoiding downloading files and apps from untrusted sources. Stay alert and stay secure!

Did you know that your Android device had a hidden Safe mode? Yes, Safe mode. Similar to Windows, Safe mode in Android boots a watered down version of the OS with only the bare essentials. 
While the OS will look and function like normal, there will be a ‘Safe Mode’ overlay present on the bottom left corner of the screen. Safe Mode is strictly for diagnostic purposes, with all your installed apps being unavailable in this mode. This makes it a great way to check if any particular app is interfering with a hardware feature of your phone or if it is really broken.
So, wondering how to boot your Android device into Safe Mode? Check out the steps below and find out.
Step 1: Long press the Power button on your Android device to bring up the Power menu.
Step 2: Tap and hold the ‘Power Off’ option for a few seconds. You will then automatically get a prompt to confirm whether you want to your boot Android device into Safe mode or not.
Step 3: Tap on Ok. Your device will then reboot and automatically boot into Safe mode. This can be confirmed from the ‘Safe mode’ overlay that will be displayed at the bottom left corner of the screen.
To boot back your Android device into normal mode, simply switch it off and power it on again.
Safe Mode is present in almost all versions of Android that I have tried — right from FroYo to Marshmallow.
