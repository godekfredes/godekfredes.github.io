Revolutionize Your Gmail Experience: Learn How To Clean Up and Organize Your Sidebar in Seconds!

Gmail is one of the most popular and powerful email services today. One of the reasons it is so popular is because of its ability to be customized according to your needs. However, with so many features, the Gmail interface can sometimes feel cluttered.

One area where you can quickly clean up your Gmail experience is the sidebar. The sidebar is the menu on the left side of the Gmail interface that displays labels, chat, and Google Meet. Here are some tips on how to clean up and organize your Gmail sidebar in seconds.

1. Hide labels you don't need

Labels are Gmail's way of categorizing your emails. By default, Gmail comes with a few pre-set labels like Inbox, Sent, Drafts, and Spam. However, you can create your own labels to sort your emails into different categories.

If you've created too many labels and your sidebar is starting to look cluttered, you can hide the labels you don't need. To do this, hover your mouse over the label you want to hide and click on the three-dot icon that appears. Then select "Hide Label" to remove it from your sidebar.

2. Rearrange your labels

Another way to clean up your Gmail sidebar is to rearrange your labels. You can simply drag and drop your labels into the order that you prefer. This way, the labels that you use the most will be at the top of your sidebar, making it easier to access them. 

3. Keep only the features you need

Aside from labels, the Gmail sidebar also displays other features like chat, Google Meet, and tasks. If you don't use these features, you can hide them from your sidebar, along with the labels. Hover your mouse over the feature and click on the three-dot icon. Then select "Remove" to remove it from your sidebar.

4. Use Gmail add-ons

If you're still having trouble organizing your Gmail sidebar, you can use add-ons like Gmelius and Simplify Gmail. These add-ons offer more customization options, like the ability to hide certain labels or features automatically.

In conclusion, the Gmail sidebar can be customized and organized according to your preferences. By following these tips, you can keep your Gmail experience clutter-free and efficient. So go ahead and revolutionize your Gmail experience today!
