# Revolutionize Your File Compatibility: Learn the Secret to Making Libreoffice "Talk" to MS Office!

Working in a collaborative environment undoubtedly calls for software programs that can read and edit files created by different applications. For instance, a project team might require files to be shared and edited across various computer programs, including Microsoft Office and LibreOffice. However, the common challenge is that these applications might not be fully compatible with each other's file formats.

This is where LibreOffice comes in as a powerful alternative to Microsoft Office that can support file compatibility with ease. LibreOffice is an open-source productivity software suite that provides various tools for word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, and more. The platform has a similar interface to MS Office, making it relatively easy to navigate for individuals who are more accustomed to Microsoft's offerings.

One of the significant benefits of LibreOffice is its capability to read and save files in Microsoft's file formats, including Office Open XML (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX), Office 97/2000/XP/2003 (DOC, XLS, PPT), and many others. This compatibility ensures that you can easily work with colleagues, regardless of their preferred office suite or computer operating system.

So, what's the secret to making LibreOffice "talk" to MS Office? Let's dive in.

## Step 1: Install LibreOffice

First, ensure that you have installed the latest version of LibreOffice on your computer. The installation process is relatively straightforward, and LibreOffice is compatible with multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Step 2: Open Files in LibreOffice

Once you have installed LibreOffice, open the application and navigate to the "File" menu. From there, choose either "Open" or "Import." LibreOffice supports many file formats, including those created in MS Office. Select the desired file, and LibreOffice should convert it to its native format for editing, without losing any of the original document's formatting or data.

## Step 3: Save Files in MS Office Formats

After editing and making changes to the document, select "File" from the menu and choose "Save As." You will then be prompted to choose a format in which to save your file. Select the desired MS Office format (e.g., DOCX, XLSX, PPTX), and the document will be saved in a format that can be easily opened and edited in MS Office.

## Bonus Tip: Customize LibreOffice

LibreOffice provides several customization options, including the ability to change the default formats it uses for saving files. To do this, open the "Tools" menu, select "Options," and navigate to the "Load/Save" section. From there, adjust the settings to your preferred formats. You can also specify the default format for saving text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

In conclusion, LibreOffice offers a convenient solution to the file format compatibility problem between various office software applications. It allows you to work seamlessly with colleagues and contribute to projects with minimal hiccups. By following these simple steps, you can make your file compatibility even more efficient and tailor LibreOffice to your needs. Give it a try and experience the difference for yourself!

And, to be honest, I do prefer the default file formats used by the open-source office suite. Those file formats (such as ODT for text documents) follow the Open Document Format, which means they are widely accepted for many common applications.
However, that doesn't mean the default file formats are the best option for some users. 
If you primarily collaborate with (or have to send files to) people who use MS Office, you might well have run into instances where those users either cannot open LibreOffice files or don't know exactly what to do with them.

Fortunately, because LibreOffice is very flexible, you can set the file formats such that they default to the MS Office types of DOCX, XLSX, etc. 
Although MS Office can open the LibreOffice file formats, they aren't nearly as widely accepted. And even though the LibreOffice formats better conform to open standards, it's sometimes a losing battle to get others to accept the open formats. 
Instead of trying to win that fight, it's often just easier to make the MS defaults your LibreOffice defaults. This makes it easier to share files, and it's also simply more familiar to most people.

 
## How to configure the LibreOffice to default to MS Office file format


Let's get those default formats changed.

 
## Requirements


The only thing you'll need for this is LibreOffice installed. You can install it on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. That's it.

You'll see three different drop-downs under Default File Format and ODF Settings. The first thing to do is select Text document from the Document Type drop-down. Then select Word 2007-365 (*.docs) from the Always Save As drop-down.
Click Apply to save the change. Once you've saved that, select Spreadsheet from the Document Type drop-down and then select Excel 2007-365 (*.xlsx). Click Apply to save the change. Do the same thing for Presentations and HTML documents, making sure to click Apply after each. With all of the file types taken care of, click OK and you're done.
And there you have it, you've just made LibreOffice slightly easier to use when you have to share those files with people who only use MS Office. Although I would recommend sticking with the Open Document Formats (simply because ODF is better at adhering to open standards), there are too many occasions when the MS Office file formats are the only acceptable option (such as when you have to upload a file to a service). Now, you have the ability to make that happen.
