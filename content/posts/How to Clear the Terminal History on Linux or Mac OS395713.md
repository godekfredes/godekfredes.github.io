Experts Reveal the Secret Technique to Purge Your Terminal History on Linux and Mac OS!

In today's digital world, every action you perform leaves a trace. On a Linux or Mac OS terminal, this can be especially true. The Terminal history, which stores every command you enter, can build up and reveal quite a bit of information about the user. From passwords to sensitive corporate information, it's important to know how to purge your terminal history regularly. Fortunately, experts reveal the secret technique to do just that.

First, let's explore why you might need to clear your terminal history in the first place. Perhaps you've entered a password and don't want it to be saved in the history for security reasons. Maybe you've entered sensitive corporate information that you don't want to be discovered. Or maybe you're just privacy-conscious and want to delete all traces of your activity. Regardless of your reason, purging your terminal history is a simple process.

On both Linux and Mac OS, you can use the "history" command to view a list of recent commands you entered. By default, Linux and Mac OS store the last 500 commands in the history file. The first step to purging your terminal history is to clear this file. To do this, enter the following command on your terminal: 

history -c 

This command clears your history file, erasing all commands you've entered so far. But it doesn't remove the history file itself. If you want to delete the history file completely, enter the following command: 

rm ~/.bash_history 

This command deletes the history file completely, so you'll start with a clean slate the next time you open your terminal.

If you want to avoid saving certain commands to your history file, Linux and Mac OS both offer a simple solution. Simply add a space before the command. For example, instead of entering "ls", enter " ls". This will prevent the command from being saved in your history file.

In conclusion, it's crucial to purge your terminal history regularly, especially if you work with sensitive information. Whether you're a Linux or Mac OS user, the process is simple and easy to follow. Use the "history -c" command to clear your current commands, and "rm ~/.bash_history" to delete the history file altogether. Remember to add a space before any command you don't want to be saved. Follow these tips, and you'll have peace of mind knowing your terminal history is clean and secure.
