Dirty Humidifier Making You Sick? Learn How To Clean It Properly and Breathe Better Now!

As the winter season approaches, many people turn to the use of humidifiers to keep their homes comfortable during the cold and dry weather. Humidifiers do a great job of adding moisture to the air, helping to alleviate dry skin, congestion, and other respiratory issues.

However, if not properly maintained, a humidifier can actually make you sick. A dirty humidifier can become a breeding ground for bacteria, mold, and other harmful microorganisms that can be released into the air you breathe. This can worsen respiratory problems, trigger allergies, and even cause infections.

Thankfully, a dirty humidifier doesn't have to be a health hazard. With the right cleaning techniques, you can prevent the buildup of harmful bacteria and other contaminants, and enjoy the benefits of a clean and healthy humidifier.

Here's how to properly clean your humidifier:

1. Turn off and unplug your humidifier. Before you start cleaning your humidifier, make sure it's completely turned off and unplugged from the power source. This will ensure your safety and prevent any accidents from occurring.

2. Empty the water and remove any filters. Remove the water tank from the base of the humidifier and pour out any remaining water. Also, remove any filters, wicks, or other parts that can be detached and cleaned separately.

3. Scrub the tank and other removable parts. Using a solution of water and white vinegar, scrub the inside of the water tank and any other detachable parts with a soft-bristled brush. Vinegar is a natural disinfectant that can effectively kill bacteria and other microorganisms. Rinse the parts thoroughly with water and let them air dry before putting them back in the humidifier.

4. Clean the base of the humidifier. Using a damp cloth, wipe the base of the humidifier to remove any dust or debris that may have accumulated. For tougher stains, you can also use a sponge or scrubbing brush with soap and water. Make sure to rinse the base thoroughly and let it dry completely before reassembling the humidifier.

5. Refill the tank and start using your clean humidifier. Once all the parts have been cleaned and dried, refill the water tank with fresh water and resume using your humidifier as usual.

Apart from regularly cleaning your humidifier, it's also important to change the water daily and replace any filters or wicks as recommended by the manufacturer. This will ensure that your humidifier continues to function properly and doesn't become a source of harmful bacteria and other pollutants.

In conclusion, a dirty humidifier can pose serious health risks, but it's easy to prevent such risks with regular cleaning and maintenance. By following these simple steps, you can keep your humidifier clean and healthy, and enjoy the numerous benefits of breathing clean and moist air.

Or maybe you like using a humidifier every night for yourself. Personally, I find one helps me sleep better, especially during allergy season.  
But when was the last time you cleaned yours? Have you wondered what kind of bacteria is living in there and ultimately going into your lungs? 

 
##  How to clean a humidifier 


The best thing you can do for your humidifier is keep it clean and use clean water. Simple as that. But knowing how to clean it effectively is important. Always consult the humidifier manufacturer's instruction manual on assembly and cleaning. 
Materials needed: 

 
White vinegarCleaning cloth or paper towelsWater1:10 bleach solutionCleaning gloves


Estimated time:

 
15 minutes of cleaning20 minutes to soak1 hour to dry
 
###  Step 1: Take it apart 


Take apart the removable pieces on your humidifier. If it has a disposable filter, this is a good time to inspect it and make sure there's no mold growing on it. If there is mold, it's time for a new filter. 

 
###  Step 2: Wipe down with white vinegar 


Soak your cleaning cloth or paper towel in vinegar and wipe down all of your humidifier's parts. Clean the base without getting the motor wet. Wipe down the tank and any other pieces. 

 
###  Step 3: Give the vinegar time to soak 


Carefully add about two cups of vinegar to your humidifier's tank, put the cap on, and swish it around.  
Humidifiers can get limescale buildup pretty much anywhere that comes in contact with water, so you can put the vinegar-filled tank on the base without the filter and let the vinegar soak for about 20 minutes. 
Don't turn on the humidifier with vinegar or any other cleaning solution inside it while you are indoors. The resulting fumes can irritate your eyes, nose, throat, and even your lungs. 

 
###  Step 4: Rinse out the vinegar 


After the vinegar has soaked in the humidifier, rinse the tank with plenty of water to clear all of it from the machine.   

 
###  Step 5: Disinfect the humidifier 


To disinfect the humidifier, we'll use bleach.  
It's important to completely rinse out the vinegar as you don't want to mix it with bleach. Now that you have cleaned your humidifier with vinegar, disinfect it with a 10% bleach solution (1:10 solution of 12.8 ounces of bleach per 1 gallon of water).  
Wearing gloves, repeat the process to wipe down your humidifier with the bleach solution to disinfect it. You can use an old toothbrush (that you'll never put in you mouth again) to get into the nooks and crannies. Always avoid getting the motor wet. 

 
###  Step 6: Thoroughly rinse with water 


Thoroughly rinse your humidifier with water -- and I mean thoroughly. You don't want any bleach in the unit the next time you turn it on; you or your family could inhale it.  
Fill and rinse the tank several times over and rinse any part that you wiped with the bleach solution. Be careful not to submerge the motor in water.  
If your humidifier has a reusable filter, rinse it a couple times using clean water. 

 
###  Step 7: Air dry and assemble humidifier 


Dry the humidifier parts to prevent the water from seeping into the base. Let your humidifier parts completely air-dry to remove any moisture before putting it back together. 
Reassemble your humidifier once it's dry. Now your humidifier is ready to be refilled with clean water and operated. 
Aside from letting your humidifier air-dry, you may want to add a water treatment to prevent bacteria growth and mold. These come as a liquid bacteriostatic, drops, or even a fish.  
Several studies have noted what has been called humidifier lung and humidifier fever, which are pulmonary inflammation and/or flu-like symptoms with fever caused by bacteria, mold, or yeast that could call your humidifier home. So the importance of keeping your humidifier clean goes beyond simply having a clean home in general. It's about your health and that of your family.
With filter-less humidifiers, I prefer using filtered or distilled water. This helps prevent limescale buildup, which can happen with tap water, and helps keep the humidifier cleaner and running smoothly. 
A filter may have a brown tinge when you take it out, but many manufacturers say this is normal. It is important to always follow the filter manufacturer's instructions on when to replace it.
