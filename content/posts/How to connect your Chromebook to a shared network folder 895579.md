# Unlock the Secret to Seamless Chromebook Connectivity with this Step-by-Step Guide to Shared Network Folders!

Technology has evolved over the years, and so has the way we work. Today, most of our work and communication is done on the cloud, from anywhere in the world. Chromebooks have emerged as a popular device in the market, with their lightweight and easy-to-use interface. However, sharing files and folders with multiple devices can be a hassle. But, fret not! In this article, we will guide you through the process of setting up shared network folders on your Chromebook for seamless connectivity.

## Step One: Create a Shared Folder

Before we start, ensure that your Chromebook is connected to the same network as your other devices. Now, create a shared folder on your computer that is accessible to everyone on the network. This folder will become the central hub where all files can be easily shared and accessed. 

## Step Two: Enable File Sharing on Your Computer

To share the folder on your computer, you need to enable file sharing. On Windows, go to Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Change advanced sharing settings. Turn on network discovery, file and printer sharing, and public folder sharing. On MacOS, go to System Preferences > Sharing > File Sharing. Click on the plus sign and add the folder that you want to share.

## Step Three: Connect Your Chromebook to the Shared Folder

Once file sharing is enabled, it is time to connect your Chromebook to the shared folder. Open the Files app on your Chromebook and click on the three dots on the top right corner. Now, select Add new service > SMB file share. Fill in the required details, including the network name, folder name, and login credentials. 

## Step Four: Access the Shared Folder on Any Device

Congratulations! You have successfully set up a shared network folder on your Chromebook. Now, you can access the folder from any device that is connected to the same network. All files will be synced automatically, enabling seamless connectivity and collaboration.

## Conclusion

Setting up a shared network folder on your Chromebook is a simple process that can save you time and effort. Whether you are working with a team or need access to files from multiple devices, this step-by-step guide will help you unlock the secret to seamless connectivity. Go ahead and give it a try, you will be amazed at how easy it is!

Take, for instance, the ability to connect to network shares from within ChromeOS. This feature has been built into the OS for some time and makes it easy to not only connect to those shares but easily access them from within the Files application.
I'm going to walk you through the process of connecting to a network share being shared by the Samba server on Pop!_OS Linux. This process can also connect to directories shared from a Windows or macOS machine (and the process is the same, regardless of which operating system is hosting the share).
The only things you'll need to make this work are an updated Chromebook and a share to connect to on your network. Ready to make this happen? Let's do it.

 
### 1. Open the Settings App


The first thing to be done is connect to the share. Your Chromebook must be connected to the same network as the machine hosting the share. Once you've ensured that is the case, log into your Chromebook and open the Settings app (from either the gear icon in the System Tray popup (Figure 1) or from within the desktop launcher.

 
### 2. Connect to the Share


From within the Settings app, click to expand the Advanced entry in the left sidebar and then click Files (Figure 2).
Accessing the Settings app from within the System Tray popup.

 
### 3. In the resulting window (Figure 3), click Add file share.
 
### 4. When the new window opens, click the Server Share drop-down.


This should reveal all of the shares available on your network (Figure 4).

### 5. Once you've located the share, go back to the Add file share window. 


Finish adding the necessary information (username and password). 
Locate the share you want to add to ChromeOS.

 
### 6. Click Add when finished. 


The Files app will automatically open, revealing the newly added share (Figure 5).

 
### 7. Click on the new entry in Files. 


You should see all of the files and directories housed within the share. That share will then always be available to your Chromebook (until you either close it by right-clicking the entry and selecting Close or if you leave the network that includes the machine housing the share).
Our network share has been added to ChromeOS Files.
Congratulations! You now have access to files and directories on that shared directory on your LAN. Enjoy.
