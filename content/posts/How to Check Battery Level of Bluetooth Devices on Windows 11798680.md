Once your device is connected to your Windows 11 computer, you can enable battery monitoring. To do this, open up the Settings app and go to "Devices" and then "Bluetooth & other devices." Click on the device you want to monitor the battery level for, and then toggle on the switch for "Battery."

From now on, you will be able to check the battery level of your Bluetooth devices by clicking on the Bluetooth icon in the taskbar. If the battery level is running low, Windows 11 will also provide you with a notification so you can replace the battery or recharge the device in time.

## Conclusion
