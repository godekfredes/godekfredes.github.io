Is Your Computer Capable of Handling Windows 11? Find Out Now with this Foolproof Guide!

Windows 11, the latest operating system (OS) from Microsoft, has generated quite a buzz in the tech community. While it promises improved performance, better security, and a sleek new interface, many users are wondering whether their current computers can handle the upgrade. Here's a guide to help you figure out if your computer is capable of running Windows 11.

First and foremost, Windows 11 has higher hardware requirements compared to its predecessor, Windows 10. Microsoft has stated that the new OS requires a PC with at least a 64-bit processor, 4 GB of RAM, and 64 GB of storage. However, these minimum requirements are just the tip of the iceberg, and they don't guarantee a smooth experience.

To get the full benefits of Windows 11, your PC should have more advanced hardware components, such as a modern CPU, dedicated graphics card, and an SSD. Here's a breakdown of the recommended hardware requirements for Windows 11:

- Processor: 1 GHz or faster with 2 or more cores on a compatible 64-bit processor or System on a Chip (SoC)
- RAM: 4 GB or more
- Storage: 64 GB or more of storage that meets the system requirements
- System firmware: UEFI, Secure Boot capable
- TPM version: TPM version 2.0
- Graphics card: DirectX 12 compatible or later with a WDDM 2.0 driver
- Display: High definition (720p) display that is greater than 9" diagonally, 8 bits per color channel

To check whether your PC meets these requirements, you can use Microsoft's PC Health Check app, which is designed to scan your computer and tell you if it's compatible with Windows 11. However, the app has been pulled by Microsoft after it failed to provide accurate results for some users. 

Thankfully, there's an alternative way to check the compatibility of your PC with Windows 11. You can download and run a third-party software called "WhyNotWin11," which gives a more detailed breakdown of your computer's hardware and its compatibility with Windows 11. The software is easy to use, and it provides a clear picture of what you need to upgrade if your computer falls short of the recommended hardware requirements.

Apart from hardware compatibility, another factor to consider is your computer's age. If your PC is a few years old, it may not be compatible with Windows 11 due to its hardware limitations. It's also worth noting that Microsoft will officially end support for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025, which means that it's only a matter of time before you'll need to upgrade to Windows 11 or a newer OS.

In conclusion, upgrading to Windows 11 is not as simple as installing a new OS on your computer. It requires a careful assessment of your PC's hardware components and age to ensure that it can handle the upgrade. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily check whether your computer is compatible with Windows 11 and take appropriate action if necessary.

In Summary


Microsoft made TPM 2.0 and Secure boot support compulsory for Windows 11 which led to confusion among users if their PC supports Windows 11 or not.
You can easily check Windows 11 compatibility using the PC Health app.
We have also covered multiple ways to check Windows 11 compatibility.







However, Microsoft made TPM 2.0 and Secure boot support mandatory for Windows 11, which angered many old PC users. In addition, this caused confusion for non-technical users as to whether their PC is compatible with Windows 11 or not. No need to worry, because today we will help you check if your PC is compatible with Windows 11.

 
## Windows 11 Minimum Hardware Requirements


Here are the minimum requirements as per Microsoft for a PC to run Windows 11.

 

Processor- 1 GHz or faster with two or more cores on a compatible 64-bit processor or System on a Chip (SoC)
Memory – 4GB
Storage – 64 GB or larger storage device
System Firmware – UEFI, Secure Boot capable
TPM – Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0
Graphics Card – DirectX 12 compatible graphics / WDDM 2.x
Display – 9″ with HD Resolution (720p)

 
## What is TPM 2.0?


TPM stands for Trusted Platform Module and is intended to provide better security to your PC. This chip is usually located on the motherboard and performs cryptographic operations to increase security and prevent attacks during the boot process. If the chip detects something malicious, it will not boot. Cryptography basically encrypts information/data into codes so that no unauthorized person can access the data.

 
## How to check if PC supports Windows 11 using PC Health Check


To avoid confusion among users about compatibility, Microsoft has released a tool that lets you quickly check if your PC supports Windows 11. In addition, you can also check the state of your PC with the app PC Health check.

 
### Steps to check Windows 11 compatibility using PC Health Check


1. Download and install PC Health Check (link for setup file is given below).
2. After installing the app, you will see all your PC specifications. Here, hit the check now option. (Make sure you have an active internet connection)

3. Once you click on check now, it will scan through the PC hardware and tell if your PC is compatible with Windows 11 or not.

Microsoft has temporarily removed the PC health check from their website and should be back around Windows 11 stable release. That said, you can still download the PC Health app from here.

 
## It shows your PC is not compatible with Windows 11. But why is it not compatible?


While the PC health check app tells if the PC is compatible with Windows 11 or not, it does not tell us why it is not compatible. Since we asked ourselves a similar question, we enlisted the help of an open-source project, “WhyNotWin11”. The app is an alternative to PC Health Check, but unlike that app, it displays a detailed report about why PC may not be compatible with Windows 11.
Using WhyNotWin11 is extremely simple. After downloading, open the app on your PC, and it starts scanning the PC to check compatibility with Windows 11. The app classifies the compatibility in three different colors – red, yellow, and green. Our PC was not compatible with Windows 11, and the app clearly showed us why. After running the check, we found out that there were several reasons.
As you can see in the attached image, multiple checkboxes are red. The main reasons being no TPM and Secure boot support. But don’t be disheartened if your PC does not meet minimum hardware requirements for Windows 11, as we have already got you covered. You can follow this guide for installing Windows 11 on unsupported hardware without TPM 2.0. Using that trick, we managed to install Windows 11 on a 12-year-old PC.

## Checking TPM support manually


If for some reason you cannot use the above software, you can also manually check if TPM 2.0 is supported.
Steps to check TPM 2.0 support manually:

 

Open the start menu and search for “tpm.msc”.

After searching, click on open.
If your PC supports TPM 2.0, it will display that after running the command. But in our case, it does not support, so we got an error message saying TPM cannot be found.
