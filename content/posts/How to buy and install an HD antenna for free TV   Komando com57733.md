Cut Your Cable Bill in Half! Learn How to Purchase and Install an HD Antenna for FREE TV Now!

Are you tired of overpaying for cable TV but still want to enjoy your favorite shows and sports events? Do you want to cut your cable bill in half or even eliminate it completely? If so, you’re in luck! In this article, we’ll show you how to purchase and install an HD antenna for free TV, no strings attached.

Why choose an HD antenna?

First of all, what is an HD antenna? It's a device that captures over-the-air HDTV signals from broadcast towers and delivers them to your TV without the need for a cable or satellite subscription. By using an HD antenna, you can receive popular channels such as ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, PBS, and CW, as well as local news, sports, and weather updates.

One of the main advantages of an HD antenna is the cost. Unlike cable or satellite TV, which can cost you hundreds of dollars a year, an HD antenna is a one-time investment that can save you money in the long run. Moreover, most HD antennas offer crystal-clear reception and uncompressed high-definition picture quality, which is often superior to cable or satellite TV.

What to consider when purchasing an HD antenna?

Before you buy an HD antenna, you need to consider a few factors, such as your location, the direction of your local broadcast towers, and the type of antenna.

Your location: The first thing to consider is your location, as it affects the strength and availability of over-the-air signals. You can check your address on FCC.gov to get a map of local broadcast towers and the channels that are available in your area.

The direction of broadcast towers: You also need to know the direction of your local broadcast towers to point your antenna in the right direction. You can use a compass or a smartphone app to find the azimuth angle of your local towers.

Type of antenna: Finally, you need to choose the type of antenna that fits your needs and budget. There are two main types of antennas: indoor and outdoor. Indoor antennas are easy to install, but they have limited range and can be affected by signal interference. Outdoor antennas, on the other hand, offer a longer range, stronger signals, and better reception, but they can be more complex to install and require more components.

How to install an HD antenna?

Once you've purchased your HD antenna, it's time to install it. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Unbox your HD antenna and read the installation guide carefully.

2. Connect the coaxial cable from your antenna to your TV. You can use a splitter if you want to connect multiple TVs.

3. Power up your TV and go to the TV menu to scan for channels. Make sure to select “antenna” or “over-the-air” as your signal source.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the channel scan. This may take several minutes to complete.

5. Once the scan is finished, you should have access to free over-the-air HDTV channels.

Conclusion

Cutting your cable bill in half or even eliminating it altogether is possible by using an HD antenna. It's a simple and affordable solution that offers high-quality over-the-air channels without the need for a cable or satellite subscription. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can purchase and install an HD antenna for free TV and enjoy all your favorite shows and sports events without breaking the bank.

But times have changed dramatically and now many are asking, have you cut the cable TV cord yet?
This, of course, is when you get rid of pricey cable and satellite subscriptions and turn to streaming services for entertainment.
If you choose to join the cord-cutting trend and become a cable cutter yourself, you’ll have to add an over-the-air TV antenna, also called nowadays an HDTV antenna, to your setup.

 
## Get free HDTV with an antenna


An HDTV antenna will allow you to pick up local channels, and several others, that will let you watch live TV for free. You might be surprised by how many free channels you can pick up with an HDTV antenna. You won’t believe how much free programming you can actually watch for free without a cable or even an internet connection.
With an HDTV antenna, you can pick up over-the-air (OTA) broadcast channels such as ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, CW, PBS, ION and many others. Many of the most popular television shows, along with sporting events and local news, are broadcast on OTA television in High Definition. FOR FREE!
When you hear the word antenna, you might think of old-school rabbit ears that struggled to give you fuzzy reception. Those days are long gone! All TV broadcasts are now in digital, always delivering a crystal clear picture if you’re in range.
But getting all the available channels in your area can be tricky. If the TV broadcast towers are miles away from your home, having your antenna in the right position is crucial for maximizing your reception.
Don’t worry, we’re here to help. Here are useful tips to get the best possible reception with your indoor TV antenna.

 
## Check for the available channels in your area


Before you shop for a TV antenna, make sure you first survey your home’s location for all the available channels and their corresponding signal strength with a tool like AntennaWeb from antenna.org.
Just enter your ZIP code and our tool will show you all the networks and their channels, their distance, band, heading (direction) and signal strength relative to that ZIP code.
Keep in mind that your home’s surrounding landscape plays a big part in your antenna selection and channel availability. If you live in an area surrounded by hills, mountains or even buildings, your reception may be poorer than what these tools indicate. On the flipside, if you live in an elevated area, you might get strong signals even from a distance.

 
## Pick the right antenna based on your geography and channel availability


Once you get a good idea of channel availability based on your location and geography, it’s time to decide what type of antenna you’ll pick. There is a wide variety of HDTV antennas available out there and you want to make sure you pick one that’s right for your needs.
First, all antennas have distance ratings so make sure you get one that covers your home’s distance from the broadcast towers. Typically, the shorter the range, the cheaper an antenna will be, so weigh your options carefully.
If there are multiple channels coming from different directions, then consider getting an omnidirectional or a multidirectional antenna. These types of antennas don’t favor any particular direction but they do give up reception strength in exchange for their farther reach.
If your desired channels are all coming from one direction, then a directional antenna is the better choice. These antennas have generally better reception and range than comparable omnidirectional antennas.
Next, check your favorite channels’ bands (UHF or VHF) and make sure that you’re picking an antenna that’s capable of both. Note: Most HD antennas available now are better at picking up the higher UHF channels than VHF channels (1-13).
Additionally, based on the broadcast tower distances from your home, consider getting an amplified antenna to improve your reception. If the broadcast towers are located 50 miles or more away from your home, then amplified antennas can help your TV receive more of these distant channels reliably.
Note: Amplified antennas also help if you’re splitting the signal to several TVs or running a long cable from the antenna to your TV.
In most cases though, an unamplified antenna should be good enough in most major areas.

 
## Install and position it for the best reception


Once your chosen antenna arrives, the fun starts. It takes only two simple steps. Anyone can do it. And if you need help, you can call us here in Phoenix and our reps will help you out!
Remember the rabbit ear twiddling we did back in the day to get the best possible picture minus the fuzz and the snow?
Well, with digital broadcasts, it’s all or nothing, you either get a perfect picture or a blank screen. (Well if you have a weak signal, you’ll get an unwatchable, choppy, pixelated mess.)
Installation is easy
Just screw the coax cable into the back of your TV like a normal antenna, and hook up the power (if the antenna is amplified). The setup shouldn’t take more than five minutes and then you can sit down to watch your favorite channels and shows.
Scan for channels
After plugging it in, have your TV scan for the available channels. It varies by manufacturer but do this by going to the TV’s Settings menu then look for an option called “Tuner,” “Auto-Program” or “Auto Scan.”
Place it in an elevated position
It’ll take a bit of trial and error to get the most out of your antenna’s reception but try putting it at an elevated location. The higher your antenna is and the fewer the obstructions (including buildings, thick walls, and mountains), the better your reception will be.
If you live in an area with good enough reception, you can even stick a flat antenna on the back of your TV. If not, try putting your antenna on top of a bookshelf, a fireplace, or stick it high on a wall to lock in a better signal.
Position it near a window
Putting it beside a window also works wonders. You can also place it near a door or a similar opening to get the best line of sight to the nearest TV towers. Try experimenting with your placement, even a single inch can make a big difference!
For the best possible reception, avoid metal objects like door or window screens. Try putting your antenna at least 6 feet away from metal.
Still struggling with your antenna’s reception due to distance? Then you may need an outdoor multidirectional antenna instead. These types of antennas work best when installed way up on a pole outside your home for best results.

 
## Electric equipment nearby could be interfering with your TV reception


Now, test it!  Unplug all computers, DVD players, stereo equipment, etc. Even fluorescent lights can cause problems. Unplug all of your TV connections except for power and the antenna and then re-test. If you see a better signal, start turning the other equipment on one at a time to see what’s causing the interference.
If there’s a lot of electronic equipment near your TV (Wi-Fi routers can be a big problem), you might want to use a longer cable for your antenna so you can move it farther away or even into a different room.
