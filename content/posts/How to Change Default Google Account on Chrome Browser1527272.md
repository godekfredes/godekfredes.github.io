Google Chrome is the most widely used web browser worldwide. It is known for its simplicity, speed, and ease of use. But did you know that there is a secret feature that can make your browsing experience even more convenient? That's right - we're talking about the ability to quickly switch your default account on Chrome browser. In this article, we will show you how to do just that!

Step 1: Identify the Default Account on Chrome Browser
Let's begin by identifying the default account set on your Chrome browser. You can do this by clicking on your profile picture located at the top right corner of your browser screen. A dropdown menu will appear displaying a list of accounts associated with your Google Chrome browser. The account with the blue tick next to it is your default account.

Step 2: Add Secondary Accounts to Your Chrome Browser
To add secondary accounts to your Google Chrome browser, click on "Manage People" from the dropdown menu mentioned above. This will take you to the "People" section where you can add new people, edit existing ones or delete profiles altogether. Click on "Add person" to add a secondary account. You will be asked to provide a name for the new profile, select an avatar, and specify whether a desktop shortcut is required.

Step 3: Switching Between Accounts on Chrome Browser
With the new secondary account set up, you can quickly switch to any account on your Chrome browser. To do this, click on the profile picture again, and select the account you want to switch to from the dropdown menu. Your Chrome browser will instantly reload with all your browsing data and preferences associated with the selected account.

Step 4: Setting a New Default Account on Chrome Browser
If you prefer your new secondary account to be the default account on your Chrome browser, you can quickly switch the default account by clicking on the three dots located beside the account name in the dropdown menu. Choose the "Edit" option, and select the "Set as default" checkbox for the account you want to set as the default. This feature will make that account the default account on Google Chrome browser from that moment.

Conclusion
Google Chrome is a powerful tool that allows you to have multiple accounts on one browser. Chrome's multiple account feature allows users to switch between accounts quickly, and easily set a default account to eliminate the confusion between accounts. This feature is not well-known, but it is incredibly helpful. By following these simple steps, you can become a pro at using this feature from Google.
