# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Put An End To Annoying Snapchat Friends - Here's Your Step-By-Step Guide!

Are you tired of seeing constant updates from people on your Snapchat friends list? Maybe you've grown apart or their posts have become too much to handle. Whatever your reason may be, ending a Snapchat friendship is easier than you think. In this step-by-step guide, we will teach you how to remove a friend from Snapchat and make sure they can't see your content anymore.

Step 1: Open Snapchat and go to your Friends List.

Before you can unfriend someone on Snapchat, you need to open the app and go to your friends list. This can be accessed by swiping right from the camera screen or by tapping on your Bitmoji in the top left corner and then tapping "My Friends."

Step 2: Find the person you want to unfriend.

Once you're on your friends list, scroll through your friends until you find the person you want to remove. Their name should be displayed with their Snapcode and username.

Step 3: Swipe left on their name and tap "More."

To unfriend someone on Snapchat, you need to swipe left on their name and tap "More." This will bring up a menu of options for that friend.

Step 4: Select "Remove Friend."

From the "More" menu, select "Remove Friend." This will confirm that you want to delete this person from your friends list, and they will no longer be able to view any of your stories or send you snaps.

Step 5: Block the person, if necessary.

If you want to take further measures to prevent this person from contacting you on Snapchat, you can choose to block them. From the same "More" menu, select "Block" and confirm that you want to block them.

Blocked users can no longer see your content or search for your account. They will also be removed from your friends list and any chats with that person will disappear.

By following these five simple steps, you can easily delete an annoying or unwanted friend from Snapchat. It's important to remember that unfriending or blocking someone is a personal choice and should be done only when necessary. Snapchat is supposed to be a fun, social platform, so make sure your friends list consists of people you actually want to interact with!
