# Unleash Your Inner Detective with This Trick to Catch Sneaky Intruders - Now with Secret Alerts on Your Home Sensors!

Do you ever feel like someone is watching you? Or worse, do you suspect someone is sneaking into your home when you're not there? We all want to feel safe and secure in our own homes, but sometimes it can be hard to know if we're truly alone.

That's where your inner detective comes in. By being observant and utilizing some clever tricks, you can catch sneaky intruders before they have a chance to do any harm. And now, with the latest home sensor technology, you can receive real-time alerts and take action even when you're away.

So, what are these clever tricks to catching a sneaky intruder? Let's dive in.

## Pay Attention to the Details

The first step in catching a sneaky intruder is to pay attention to the details around your home. Are there items out of place? Is a window or door unlocked when you're sure you locked it? These could be signs that someone has been in your home.

You should also be mindful of any strange behavior in your neighborhood. Have you noticed a car or person lingering around your area lately? Don't dismiss these observations as coincidence; they could be the first clues in a potential break-in.

## Set Up Motion Sensor Alerts

Now, here's where the latest home sensor technology comes in. Motion sensors are a fantastic way to catch sneaky intruders because they can detect movement even when you're not home. And with the latest advancements in smart home technology, you can now receive secret alerts on your phone when motion is detected in your home.

There are a few options when it comes to motion sensors. Some are standalone devices that are powered by batteries, while others are integrated into other smart home devices like security cameras. If you're not sure where to start, consider working with a professional security company to help you select and install the best sensors for your home.

## Take Action

So, you've paid attention to the details and set up your motion sensors. Now, it's time to take action if you receive an alert. If you're home, immediately investigate the area and call the police if you suspect an intruder. If you're away, alert the police and ask a trusted neighbor to investigate for you.

It's important to remember to never confront an intruder on your own. Your safety is paramount, and it's always best to leave it to the professionals.

## Conclusion

By unleashing your inner detective and utilizing the latest home sensor technology, you can catch sneaky intruders and keep your home and family safe. Remember to pay attention to the details, set up your motion sensors, and take action when necessary. With these tools and some clever detective work, you can rest easy knowing that you're always one step ahead of any would-be intruders.

I once welcomed a few friends to my house. One of them got cold and asked if she could borrow a jacket, so I pointed her toward my coat closet. When she came out to join us, she had both my coat and one of the photo albums I had placed on the top shelf.
Let this be a lesson to you: If you give people the opportunity to snoop, they probably will. That’s why we’re sharing a little-known trick you can use to keep nosy guests in check. This tech tip is brought to you by our sponsor, SimpliSafe.

 
## Protect your private zones


Sure, you can tell your friends that some areas are off-limits. But some people see it as a challenge. Others might even have sticky fingers.
Luckily, there’s a way you can protect your medicine cabinet, safe or bedroom. To catch snoops in the act, use SimpliSafe’s Secret Alerts. This feature alerts you when someone is poking around a private area.
First, you need to set up some entry sensors. For example, if you don’t want anyone poking around your wine cellar, set up sensors around the entrance. 
Then, open your app and enable the Secret Alert feature. This way, whenever someone triggers the sensor, you get a discreet alert on your phone. Here’s how to set up Secret Alerts:

 
Open the SimpliSafe app on your phone.Tap Menu. Select Device Settings. Tap Refresh & Edit.Select your entry sensor of choice and enable Secret Alerts.


In less than 30 seconds, you just created a secret, snoop-proof alarm. You’ll learn when someone is poking around where they shouldn’t be. If you’re feeling mischievous, you could even sneak up behind them and ask, “What are you doing?” 
Hopefully, they’ll be so scared they’ll stop sneaking around. Now that you know how to catch snoops, you should also know that there’s a lot more SimpliSafe can do.
