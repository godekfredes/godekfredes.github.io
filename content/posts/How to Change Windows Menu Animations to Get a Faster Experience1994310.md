### Using One-Click Registry Hacks


Well, Howtogeek has shared a one-click registry hack that reduces the menu animation to 200. By default, the menu animation has been set to 400 milliseconds. The registry files perform everything we mentioned in the first method.
So, if you don’t want to go through all the stuff mentioned in the first method, you can use the hacks provided by howtogeek.
Menu-Animation-Speed-Hacks

You will get a downloadable ZIP file which you need to extract with 7zip or Winrar. Once done, You will see two registration Entries – Reduce Menu Animation to 200 and Restore Menu animation to 400.
The ‘Reduce Menu Animation to 200’ hack sets the menu animation speed to 200 milliseconds. However, if you want to reverse the changes and restore them to the default, you need to use the ‘Restore Menu Animation to 400.’

Not just that, but you can also do a little bit of experiment. For example, you can set the values ranging from 0 to 4000 milliseconds by editing the ‘Reduce Menu Animation to 200’ hack. However, don’t modify the ‘Restore Menu Animation to 400.reg file because it reverses every change.
So, this is how you can speed up your Windows 10 computer by disabling the visual effects. If you need more help disabling the Windows 10 Menu animations, let us know in the comments below.
