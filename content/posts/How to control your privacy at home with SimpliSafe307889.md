How many times has a stranger showed up to your door and turned your doorknob to check to see if the door was unlocked? Would you even notice if you were at home and they were very careful not to make a sound? You probably already know many homes are burglarized without any signs of forced entry.
Unfortunately, these types of activities happen every day all across America. The good news is you can fight back with the right protection and tools, like a video doorbell monitoring system. Protect your home and privacy with the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro from the only home security system Kim uses and recommends.

## Easy to install no matter when your home was built


With some security systems, you have to worry about capability issues with your home, especially if your home was built before a certain year or was newly built. It can be time-consuming and frustrating to research all the specs to make sure it will be the best fit with your home.
