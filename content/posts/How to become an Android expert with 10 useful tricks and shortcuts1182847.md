Are you tired of feeling like a novice when it comes to Android app development? Do you want to take your skills to the next level and become an Android pro? Then look no further! In this guide, we will give you the 10 simple steps you need to become an expert in developing Android apps. 

## Step 1: Get familiar with Java

Before you can begin developing Android apps, you need to know Java. Java is the language used to build Android apps, so start learning the fundamentals of Java programming by taking online courses or reading books.

## Step 2: Install Android Studio

The next step is to install Android Studio, which is the official tool used for developing Android apps. Android Studio provides you with all the necessary tools to build, run and debug your applications. Install it and start exploring the various features it offers.

## Step 3: Get familiar with Android architecture

Android architecture is different from other platforms, which means you'll need to get familiar with its specific components such as Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers, and Content Providers. Develop sample apps to get a good understanding of these components.

## Step 4: Learn about Android User Interface

A good user interface can make or break an app, so make sure you learn about User Interface design. Get familiar with the various UI components available in Android such as Layouts, Views, and Widgets.

## Step 5: Study Android Material Design Guidelines

While developing Android apps, keep in mind the Android Material Design principles. These guidelines offer a set of principles and best practices that are critical for creating visually attractive and user-friendly apps.

## Step 6: Become proficient in Debugging

Debugging is part of the Android app development process. Therefore, learn the tools and techniques required to debug Android applications. Android Studio provides a debugger that makes debugging easier.

## Step 7: Embrace Test-Driven Development

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development approach that helps in building bug-free and high-quality software. Embrace TDD while developing Android apps to achieve higher productivity and efficiency.

## Step 8: Learn about Android Libraries

Save time and effort by using Android Libraries. These libraries are pre-built functions that you can include in your app to perform specific tasks. For instance, you can use the Retrofit library for network operations.

## Step 9: Learn about Cloud Services

Cloud Services like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Firebase, and Google Cloud Platform, provide easy and quick access to app services such as Authentication, Storage, and Analytics. Learn how to integrate these services in your Android apps.

## Step 10: Keep Practicing

Practice is the key to becoming an Android Pro. Start by developing small apps and keep building your way to more complex apps. Consistent practice will help you build your skills and confidence in Android development. 

In conclusion, the road to becoming an Android pro will not happen overnight, and it will require dedication, hard work, and consistent practice.

However, tips and tricks will be less helpful if your Android device already has an issue. Tap or click here to find out if your Android device has a virus.
There are many ways to make your gadgets more efficient with just a few taps. Whether you’re an advanced user or someone who’s not so tech-savvy, these tricks and shortcuts are sure to cut down on headaches and make your phone easier than ever to use!

 
## 1. Universal gestures


Tired of moving your finger all the way down to the back button? Android 10 has new universal gestures, so regardless of what app you have open simply swipe back to move back a single step. It sounds small because it is, but once you get used to swiping instead of using the back button, you’ll be amazed by how much time you save.

 
## 2. Easy menu access


When in an app with a menu, users can use two fingers to access the said menu instead of using a back swipe.

 
## 3. Customizable battery saver mode


Some Android phones come with Battery Saver Mode that turns on by default when your battery hits a 5% charge. But this can be changed according to your individual routine. 
For example, if you regularly notice your device runs out of juice by 6 p.m. but you can’t typically charge it until 8 p.m., consider adjusting Battery Saver Mode to kick in earlier. To find out if your phone offers Battery Saver Mode, go to your device manufacturer’s support site.

 
## 4. Turn off auto-rotate


Depending on what you’re doing on your phone at any given moment, you may or may not want your device to automatically switch to landscape view. Simply go to Settings > Display > Advanced and turn off auto-rotate if the feature bothers you, or you can do this in Quick Settings by pulling down on the notification shade.

 
## 5. Easily share Wi-Fi passwords


Don’t worry about remembering your Wi-Fi password to share with friends and family when you can share them easily with just a few taps. From Quick Settings, press and hold the Wi-Fi icon; tap the network you’d like and click Share. This will display a QR code anyone who wants to join your Wi-Fi can scan with an app like Google Lens.
However, not all QR code scanner apps are reputable. Tap or click here for a list of 17 malicious Android apps you should avoid.

 
## 6. Don’t be distracted by notifications with Focus Mode


As part of Google’s Digital Wellbeing app, users can stop distracting notifications by entering Focus Mode. To turn on Focus Mode go to Settings > Digital Wellbeing & Parental Controls > Focus Mode, or tap the Digital Wellbeing app in your app list. When enabling Focus Mode, you can add or remove apps to a personal blacklist so you can control exactly what you do and don’t want to be bothered by while in Focus Mode.

 
## 7. Change battery charge percentage to time left


If it’s too hard for you to estimate how much time you have left before your phone dies when looking at a percentage, you can change the percentage to time left on charge. To do this simply go to Settings, then Battery.

 
## 8. Live Captions


On Pixel 3 and up, press a volume button and look for the small rectangle with a line through it beneath the familiar volume controls onscreen. Tapping this rectangle activates Live Captioning. Live Captioning will provide a real-time description of everything said in any media playing on your device. 

 
## 9. Simple screen recording


For Galaxy phones using Android 10, screen recording is now easier than ever. Swipe down from the top of the screen twice, then swipe to the left to scroll through a list, and select Screen Recorder. You are now able to record whatever is happening onscreen. Tap or click here for more details.

 
## 10. Give your phone a classy new look


If your phone has a decent screen, particularly an OLED one, you might want to consider making use of those perfect blacks by turning on Dark Mode. Simply navigate to Settings, then Display to enable Dark Mode. For daytime and other uses, consider picking new icons, fonts and color schemes by navigating to Settings, then Styles and Wallpapers.
Once you’ve wrapped your head around all these tricks and shortcuts, there’s still more you can do with your Android. Tap or click here for the most-downloaded Android apps you’ve never heard of before.
