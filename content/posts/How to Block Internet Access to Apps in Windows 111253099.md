## What is App Access?

App access refers to the ability of apps to connect to the internet and send and receive data. Most modern apps require internet access to function properly. For example, a web browser needs internet access to load web pages, and a video streaming app needs internet access to stream content.

However, some apps may access the internet without your knowledge or consent. These apps may collect your personal data, track your online activities, or serve you targeted ads. This can compromise your privacy, security, and even your identity.

## How to Block App Access in Windows 11?

1. Protect your privacy: By blocking app access, you can prevent apps from collecting your personal data and tracking your online activities.

2. Prevent malware: Some apps may contain malware that can infect your device and steal your data. By blocking app access, you can prevent these apps from communicating with their servers and spreading malware.
