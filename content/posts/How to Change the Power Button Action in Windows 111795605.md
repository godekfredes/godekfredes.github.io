Unlock Secret Windows 11 Trick: Change Your Power Button Action Like A Pro!

Windows 11 comes with a host of new features and customization options for users. One of these features is the ability to change the power button action on your system. By default, the power button on your Windows 11 PC or laptop is set to shut down the system, but you can change this action to hibernate or sleep. 

In this article, we’ll show you how to change the power button action on your Windows 11 device.

Step 1: Open the Power & Battery Settings Panel

The first step in changing your power button action in Windows 11 is to open the Power & Battery settings panel. You can do this by clicking on the battery icon in the taskbar and selecting "Power & battery settings".

Step 2: Choose “Additional power settings”

Once you’ve opened the Power & Battery settings panel, click on the "Additional power settings" option. This will open the Power Options Control Panel.

Step 3: Change the power button action

In the Power Options Control Panel, click on the “Choose what the power button does” option. Here, you’ll see the default settings for your power button action - which is typically set to “Shut down” by default.

To change the power button action to “Hibernate” or “Sleep,” click on the drop-down menu and select your preferred option. Once you’ve made your selection, click on the “Save changes” button to apply your changes.

And that’s it! You’ve successfully changed the power button action on your Windows 11 device.

Why Change the Power Button Action?

You may be wondering why you should bother changing the power button action on your Windows 11 device. Well, changing the power button action can be beneficial in a couple of ways.

Firstly, it can help you save time. If you often use the hibernate or sleep features, changing the power button action means you won’t have to go through the extra step of manually selecting these options from the Start menu.

Secondly, changing the power button action can help you save battery life. Hibernate, for instance, is a power-saving mode that essentially turns off your device but saves the state of your open apps and documents, so you can pick up where you left off when you turn your device back on. This means your device will consume less power compared to being left on sleep mode or remaining turned on.

Conclusion

Changing the power button action on your Windows 11 device is a simple process that can have a big impact on your user experience. By default, the power button is set to shut down your device, but you can change it to hibernate or sleep mode with just a few clicks. Try it out and see how it works for you!
