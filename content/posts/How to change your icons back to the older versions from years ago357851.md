# Unlock the Secret to Time-Traveling with Your Icons: Transform Your Desktop into a Blast from the Past!

Have you ever wished you could travel back in time and experience the world as it was decades ago? Well, while we may not have discovered the secret to time travel just yet, we do have something that comes close: our computer desktops.

Your desktop is the first thing you see when you turn on your computer; it's where you organize your files, launch your favorite apps, and, of course, enjoy your favorite wallpapers. But what if you could turn it into something more? What if you could take a trip down memory lane and experience a different era with just a few clicks?

With the right icons, you can do just that. Icons are the little images that sit on your desktop, representing your files and folders. They may seem like a small detail, but they can actually have a big impact on your overall desktop experience.

By swapping out your standard icons for retro-inspired ones, you can give your desktop a whole new look and feel. Imagine clicking on an icon and being transported to the world of the 80s or 90s, with bright neon colors, quirky characters, and pixelated graphics.

To get started, you'll need to find some retro icons that fit your style. You can find plenty of free options online, or you can create your own using an icon editor like IconWorkshop or Axialis IconGenerator.

Once you've found your perfect set of icons, it's time to install them on your computer. This process will vary depending on your operating system, but typically, you'll need to right-click on the file containing the icons and choose "Copy." Then, go to your desktop, right-click, and select "Paste."

Now, with your new retro icons in place, it's time to start organizing your files and folders. You can create categories like "Music," "Photos," or "Games" and assign different icons to each one. For example, you could use a boombox icon for your music files or a joystick icon for your games.

But the fun doesn't have to stop there. You can also customize your wallpaper to create a complete retro-themed desktop experience. There are plenty of wallpapers online that feature classic video game characters, famous movies, or iconic symbols of past eras.

With your new icons and wallpaper in place, you'll feel like you've stepped back in time every time you turn on your computer. And who knows? Maybe one day we'll discover the true secret to time travel, but until then, we can enjoy our own little slice of nostalgia right on our desktops.

But like with many things back then, what worked in 2010 wouldn’t work today. Buggy sensors (remember Antennagate?) and a tiny 3.5-inch screen would make it tricky for most modern smartphone users to cope with. 
And that’s not even counting the dated graphic design — which lacks the flat, digital sheen found on most modern apps in favor of bubbly icons and 3D-textures like leather and glass.
But for those of us who miss the innocent days of Web 2.0, there’s actually a way to make your phone look a decade older without sacrificing your screen and speed. 
Icon Rewind lets you take a trip back in time by reskinning your app icons to look like their ancient counterparts. Just have the app you want to change installed, visit Icon Rewind’s website and follow the onscreen instructions.
Icon Rewind will then create shortcuts to your apps that look identical to older icons from years ago. It’s safe to do, and 100% authentically retro. It doesn’t change any settings on your phone or fudge around with your coding, either, and you can easily go back to normal if you get tired of all the nostalgia.
It’s not the most elegant solution to app reskinning, but your results will be uncanny. Well, aside from showing on a screen double the size of the iPhone 4’s. But who wants to go back to that?
