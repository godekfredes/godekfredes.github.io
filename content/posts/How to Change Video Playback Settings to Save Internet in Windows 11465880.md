Revolutionize Your Video Streaming: Learn How To Save Internet Data with One Easy Trick in Windows 11!

Video streaming has become a popular pastime and one of the primary sources of entertainment for many people. However, it can also quickly consume your internet data if not managed properly. Fortunately, there is one easy trick to revolutionize your video streaming and help save internet data on your Windows 11 device.

Windows 11 comes with a built-in feature called 'Data Usage' that helps users monitor and control their internet data usage. Using this feature, users can set a limit on the amount of data that their device can consume within a specified period.

Here's how you can use the 'Data Usage' feature to save your internet data while streaming videos on your Windows 11 device:

Step 1: Click on the Start icon in the Windows taskbar and select ‘Settings.’

Step 2: In the Settings menu, click on ‘Network & internet’ and select ‘Data usage’ from the left side panel.

Step 3: Turn on the ‘Set limits for network usage’ toggle button.

Step 4: Below the toggle button, select the ‘Monthly’ option from the drop-down menu and set the data limit according to your internet data plan.

Step 5: Scroll down to the ‘Background data’ section and turn off the toggle button for all the apps that you do not want to consume data in the background.

Step 6: Scroll further down to the ‘Data limits for apps and games’ section and click on ‘Add limit’ to set data usage limits for individual apps.

Step 7: Select the app for which you want to set data usage limits and set the monthly data limit accordingly.

Once you have set the data usage limits, Windows 11 will notify you when your device reaches its limit, and you can manage your data usage accordingly. By doing so, you can easily save your internet data while streaming videos without compromising on the quality of the videos.

Apart from the above-mentioned trick, you can also save internet data while streaming videos by making some simple changes to your streaming settings. For instance, you can lower the video quality to save data or download videos when connected to Wi-Fi and watch them later offline.

In conclusion, video streaming is a great way to relax and unwind, but it can quickly consume your internet data if you're not careful. However, with the ‘Data Usage’ feature in Windows 11, you can easily monitor and control your data usage while streaming videos. Try this one easy trick today and revolutionize your video streaming experience!
