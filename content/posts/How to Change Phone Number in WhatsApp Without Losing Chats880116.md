Say Goodbye to Phone Number Hassles on WhatsApp - Here's the Ultimate Trick to Keep Your Chats & Change Your Number Easily!

Changing your phone number can be quite a hassle, especially when you have to notify all your contacts about it. This can be a bigger pain when you're using WhatsApp, where the app uses your phone number as the primary identifier. However, WhatsApp has introduced a new feature that makes changing your phone number simpler and easier than ever before. In this article, we'll explore this feature and guide you through the process of changing your WhatsApp number hassle-free.

The feature we're talking about is called "Change Number," and it's available on both iOS and Android devices. This feature allows you to change your WhatsApp number while keeping your chat history, group memberships, and settings intact. This means you don't have to start from scratch and lose all your conversations when you switch to a new number.

The first step to changing your WhatsApp number is to create a backup of your chats. This backup can be stored on your phone's memory or on a cloud service like Google Drive or iCloud. To back up your chats on iOS, go to WhatsApp Settings > Chats > Chat Backup > Back up Now. On Android, open WhatsApp > Settings > Chats > Chat backup > Back up Now. Make sure your backup is complete and up to date because you won't be able to restore any messages after you change your number.

After backing up your chats, go to WhatsApp Settings > Account > Change Number. You'll be prompted to enter your old and new phone numbers. WhatsApp will then verify your new number by sending an SMS code or an automated call. Once your number is verified, you'll be asked if you want to notify your contacts about the change. If you select this option, WhatsApp will send a message to all your chats informing them of your new number. You can also choose to exclude some contacts from this notification.

When you change your WhatsApp number, your chat history, groups, and settings will be transferred to the new number. Your profile information, including your name, photo, and status, will also be carried over. However, your old number will no longer be associated with your account, and any messages sent to that number will not show up in your chats.

It's important to note that changing your WhatsApp number doesn't affect your phone number with your service provider. You'll still have the same plan, features, and billing with your carrier. However, if you're using WhatsApp Business, you'll need to re-verify your business account with your new number.

In conclusion, changing your phone number on WhatsApp doesn't have to be a hassle anymore. With the new "Change Number" feature, you can switch to a new number without losing your chats, groups, or settings. Just remember to back up your chats before making the switch, and notify your contacts if necessary. So, don't let phone number hassles get in the way of your WhatsApp experience. Try the "Change Number" feature today and enjoy a seamless transition!
