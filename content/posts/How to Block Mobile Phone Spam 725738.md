# You Won't Believe How Easy it is to Block Mobile Phone Spam - Say Goodbye to Annoying Calls and Texts Now!

Mobile phone spam is a growing problem that has the potential to disrupt your daily life. Spam calls and texts can be incredibly frustrating, especially when they interrupt your work and personal time. Luckily, there are several ways to block mobile phone spam easily and efficiently.

First, take advantage of your cell phone's built-in blocking features. Both Android and iOS devices offer built-in options for blocking calls and texts. For example, on an iPhone, you can go to "Settings," then "Phone," and then "Blocked Contacts" to add numbers to your blocked list. On an Android phone, go to "Settings," then "Call," "Call Blocking," and add the numbers to the "Block List." Once a number is on your blocked list, they won't be able to call or text you anymore.

Another option to address spam is to use a third-party application. There are several applications available that can help you filter out spam calls and texts. Some of these apps include Truecaller, Hiya, and RoboKiller. These applications are easy to use and can help protect you from unwanted calls and texts.

Finally, consider signing up for the National Do Not Call Registry. The registry is a government-run service that allows you to add your phone number to a list of numbers that telemarketers are not allowed to call. This is a great option for those who experience frequent unwanted telemarketing calls.

In conclusion, blocking mobile phone spam is simple and easy. Remember to use your built-in blocking options, consider downloading a third-party app, and sign up for the National Do Not Call Registry. By utilizing these options, you can say goodbye to annoying calls and texts and enjoy a more peaceful, spam-free life.

Also, you have the option of blocking your SMS email gateway from their website.
But every major phone company has such a service.

#### A few useful tips:




 

Do not leave your phone number on sites claiming to give you free minutes, SMS messages, or any other service. They cannot do this!
If you see web pages claiming you have won a prize, be it $1 million or a brand new iPhone 7 (kidding), do not fill any forms or give any information about yourself. Actually, do not even click them. You can get viruses on your computer.
If salespersons call you, save the number and never answer again, or report it to the carrier.
Do not forget that almost all phones have some manner of call or SMS blocker, not only smartphones, so look it up and create blacklists with the numbers that spam you.
If you do answer, do not give them any information. Be very careful. Some even say they represent the phone company or other utilities, do not give them any information unless you are sure about who you are talking to.
