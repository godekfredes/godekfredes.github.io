Revamp Your Android Experience: Here's How You Can Set Your Wallpaper to Change Automatically With Dark and Light Mode!

If you're looking for a quick and easy way to refresh your Android's look and feel, changing your wallpaper is a great place to start. But why settle for just one wallpaper when you can have two or more? And why manually switch between them when your phone can do it for you? With the latest Android operating systems, you can set your wallpaper to change automatically based on your dark and light mode preferences. Here's how to do it.

Step 1: Find the right wallpapers

Before you start setting up your automatic wallpaper changer, you'll want to gather the images you want to use. You can choose one light and one dark version of the same image or pick two completely different ones. To make the most of automatic mode switching, it's best to go for wallpapers with strong contrast between dark and light elements. You can find free wallpapers online or make your own using photo editing tools.

Step 2: Set your wallpapers

Once you have your wallpapers, it's time to set them up. To do this, go to your phone's wallpaper settings by long-pressing your home screen or going through the Settings app. Select the first wallpaper you want to use, then choose "Set as wallpaper." Repeat with the second wallpaper.

Step 3: Turn on automatic mode switching

Now that you have your wallpapers set up, it's time to activate automatic mode switching. This feature is available on Android devices running Android 10 and newer operating systems. To turn it on, go to Settings > Display > Wallpaper > Styles and wallpapers. Here, you'll see a toggle for "Automatic mode switching." Turn it on, and your phone will now change your wallpaper automatically when you switch between light and dark mode.

Step 4: Test it out

To see your new wallpaper-changing feature in action, switch between dark and light mode on your phone. You should see your wallpaper change automatically to match. Note that it might take a few seconds for the switch to happen.

Conclusion

With these simple steps, you can revamp your Android experience and make your phone feel fresh and new again. Automatic mode switching makes it easy to enjoy two or more wallpapers without having to manually switch between them. Try it out and see how it enhances your Android experience!

Furthermore, some Android smartphones allow the dark mode and night mode to be scheduled. When you switch to dark mode on Android, almost every operating system element gets the dark theme, but not the wallpaper.
When you switch to the dark mode, all apps and notifications are blacked out, but going back to the home screen will still be blinding since the night mode doesn’t affect the wallpaper.
This is where an Android app called ‘Dark Light Mode Scheduler’ comes into play. The app lets you choose a wallpaper for light and dark modes. So, whenever the mode switches, the wallpaper will change automatically with it.
