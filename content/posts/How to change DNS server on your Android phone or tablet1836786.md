Revolutionize Your Internet Speed: Learn How To Change DNS Server on Your Android Device Now!

As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the internet has become an essential part of our daily lives. Whether it's for work, entertainment, or education, a fast and reliable internet connection is critical for staying connected to the world.

If you're an Android user looking to improve your internet speed, one simple solution is to change your DNS server. DNS stands for Domain Name System, and it is responsible for translating website names into IP addresses. By default, your Android device uses the DNS server provided by your internet service provider (ISP), but you can change it to a faster and more reliable DNS server.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to change your DNS server on your Android device:

Step 1: Open the Settings app on your Android device.

Step 2: Select "Wi-Fi" or "Network & Internet" depending on your Android version.

Step 3: Tap on the Wi-Fi network you're connected to, and then tap "Edit."

Step 4: Scroll down and tap "Advanced options."

Step 5: Under "IP settings," select "Static."

Step 6: In the "DNS 1" and "DNS 2" fields, enter the IP addresses of the DNS server you want to use. You can find a list of fast and reliable DNS servers online.

Step 7: Tap "Save" to apply your changes.

Congratulations, you've successfully changed your DNS server. Your Android device will now use the new DNS server to resolve website names, which can result in faster and more reliable internet speeds.

Changing your DNS server can also improve your online security and privacy. Some DNS servers are designed to block malicious websites and protect your device from malware and phishing attacks. Additionally, changing your DNS server can help you bypass internet censorship and access content that may be restricted in your region.

In conclusion, changing your DNS server is a simple yet effective way to improve your internet speed and enhance your online security and privacy. Give it a try and see the difference it can make for your Android device.

How to change DNS server on your Android phone or tablet manually 
NOTE: You cannot change the DNS servers of already known Wi-Fi networks. You must remove them from the list of known Wi-Fi networks and then connect to them again during which you will be able to enter a DNS server of your choice.
Step 1: Go to Settings -> Wi-Fi. Then tap and hold the Wi-Fi network your are currently connected and click on Forget.
Step 2: Tap on the name of the Wi-Fi network again at which point you will be asked to enter the password.
Step 3: Once you have entered the password, scroll down and select Advanced options. Change IP settings from DHCP to Static
 
Step 4: Scroll down to DNS 1 and DNS 2 and enter your preferred DNS addresses. Once done, tap the Join button.
Using apps from the Google Play Store
You can also try DNSet and Dns Changer to change your DNS server on your Android phone or tablet. These apps do not require root (allow root access does allow for more options when dealing with DNS issues) and will automatically change your server once enabled.

 

DNSet
Dns Changer



Using Dns Changer, run the application and select 2 servers from the available server list.

Once your two servers are selected, Dns Changer will notify you of a successful connection.

 
Do note though that these apps only work with selected versions of Android and do not change the default DNS server while using a 3G connection. For the latter, you will need to use an app called Override DNS, though it requires root access to work properly.
