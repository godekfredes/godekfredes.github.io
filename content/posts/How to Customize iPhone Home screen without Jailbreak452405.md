Are you tired of your iPhone's default home screen? Do you want to give your device a new look and make it stand out from the crowd? Then, it's time to unlock the secrets and customize your iPhone home screen like a pro!

Thanks to the latest iOS 14 update, you can now completely transform your iPhone's home screen without jailbreaking your device. In this article, we will cover some tips and tricks to help you create a unique and personalized home screen with a few simple steps.

### Step 1: Choose Your Widgets and App Icons

The first step to customizing your iPhone home screen is choosing your widgets and app icons. Widgets are a new feature in iOS 14 that lets you add a dynamic block of content to your home screen. You can add widgets for almost anything, like weather, news, music, calendar, and more.

To add a widget, press and hold on the home screen until the apps start shaking. Then, tap the "+" icon in the top-left corner, and choose a widget size. Next, choose the widget you want to add and customize it to your liking.

Next, let's move on to app icons. With iOS 14, you can now change the appearance of your app icons to whatever you want, regardless of what the original icon looks like. You can either download custom icons from the App Store, or create your own using apps like Canva or Adobe Illustrator.

Once you have your custom icons, you'll need to create shortcuts for each app. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the Shortcuts app on your iPhone and tap the "+" icon.
2. Tap "Add Action" and search for "Open App."
3. Select the app you want to customize and tap "Done."
4. Tap the "..." icon in the top-right corner and choose "Add to Home Screen."
5. Choose a name for your app and tap "Add."

Now, you should have a new app shortcut on your home screen with your custom icon.

### Step 2: Choose Your Background and Wallpaper

Once you've selected your widgets and app icons, it's time to choose your background and wallpaper. You can choose from one of the default backgrounds provided by Apple or use your own photo.

To change your background or wallpaper, go to Settings > Wallpaper > Choose a New Wallpaper. You can select an image from your Camera Roll or choose from one of the pre-installed wallpapers.

### Step 3: Arrange Your Icons

Lastly, it's time to arrange your icons on your home screen. You can now create custom app folders and stack widgets on top of each other for a more organized and personalized look.

To create a folder, press and hold an app icon until it starts shaking. Then, drag it on top of another app icon until the folder is created. You can then rename the folder to whatever you want and add more apps to it.

To stack widgets, simply drag one widget on top of another until they are stacked on top of each other. You can then swipe through your widgets by tapping on the stack.

### Conclusion

With a few simple steps, you can now customize your iPhone home screen like a pro. From choosing your widgets and app icons to arranging your icons and creating folders, the possibilities are endless.

So, what are you waiting for? Unlock the secrets and give your iPhone a new look and feel today!
