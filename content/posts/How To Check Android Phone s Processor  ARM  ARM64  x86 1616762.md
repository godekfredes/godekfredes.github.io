Title: Discovering the Power of Your Android Phone Processor: A Simple Guide

Are you wondering if your Android phone has a powerful processor? The good news is that finding out is incredibly easy, and you don't need any technical knowledge or special software. With just a few simple steps, you can assess the horsepower of your device and see if it's up to the task of running the latest apps and games.

So, without further ado, let's dive in and discover the might of your Android phone processor.

Step 1: Check the Device Specifications

The first and most obvious step to determine the processor power in your Android phone is to check the device specifications. You can typically find this information in your phone's settings or on the manufacturer's website. Look for the "About phone" or "Device information" section and search for details like CPU architecture, clock speed, and number of cores.

If you have a newer phone, you'll likely see a chip from Qualcomm, Samsung, or MediaTek, which are some of the leading chipmakers in the market. Generally, higher numbers in these specs translate into a more powerful processor.

Step 2: Use Benchmarking Tools

If you want a more accurate assessment of your phone's processor, you can use benchmarking tools that are built specifically for this purpose. These apps run a series of tests on your device, measuring its performance in areas like processing power, memory management, and graphics capabilities.

Some popular benchmarking apps include Antutu, Geekbench, and 3DMark. You can download these apps from the Google Play Store and run them on your phone to get detailed reports on its processor power and other technical aspects.

Step 3: Test with Real-World Applications

Benchmarking tools are great for getting a general idea of your phone's processor performance, but they don't always reflect real-world usage scenarios. That's why it's a good idea to test your device with real-world applications that you use on a daily basis.

For example, you can try opening and switching between multiple apps, playing graphics-intensive games, or streaming high-resolution videos. If your phone handles these tasks smoothly without any lag or stuttering, it's a sign of a capable processor.

In Conclusion

In conclusion, finding out if your Android phone has a powerful processor is a simple and straightforward process. By checking the device specifications, using benchmarking tools, and testing with real-world applications, you can get a good understanding of your phone's processing power and its ability to handle the latest apps and games.

Remember, having a powerful processor is not the only thing that makes a great smartphone. Other factors like battery life, camera quality, and software features also play an important role. But knowing how to assess your phone's processor power can help you make informed buying decisions and ensure that you get the most out of your device.

So, to download the right files, it becomes essential to know which processor your phone has. It’s worth noting that if you are downloading apps from the Google Play Store, then it’s not important to know the CPU architecture. However, if you are going to sideload app updates or install any custom ROM, then knowing the right CPU architecture is the first best thing to do.
There are multiple ways to check Android Phone’s Processor. Below, we are going to share an easy method that would help you to know the CPU architecture used in your phone. So, let’s find out how to check Android Phone’s Processor.

 
## Check Android Phone’s Processor (ARM, ARM64, x86)


Before we share with you the method to check the Android Phone’s Processor, let’s know about the three main CPU Architectures – ARM, ARM64, and x86. Out of these three, ARM is the most common one, and it’s optimized for battery consumption. ARM64 is an upgraded version of ARM architecture that supports 64-bit processing to provide powerful computing. The remaining one is the x86, which is powerful than ARMs, but it’s not battery friendly.
Now that you know about the CPU architecture, let’s know how to check processor of any Android:
Step 1. First of all, download and install Droid Hardware Info on your Android smartphone from this link.
Step 2. Open the app and grant the permissions.
Step 3. Next, the app will ask you to grant the storage permissions. Simply tap on ‘Allow’ to continue.
Step 4. On the next page, you will see the device information. It will list your model number, manufacturer, etc.
Step 5. Select the ‘System’ tab and then note the ‘CPU Architecture’. Below is the common name for the device’s CPU Type.
ARM: ARMv7 or armeabi ARM64: AArch64 or arm64 x86: x86 or x86abi
That’s it, you are done! This is how you can check the processor of any Android Phone.

 
### Some Other Apps


Just like Droid Hardware Info, there are few other Android apps available on the Play Store that can be used to check the processor. Below, we have shared a few best Android apps to know the CPU architecture used in your Android smartphone.

 
#### 1. Device Info


If you are searching for a simple and powerful Android app to find out complete information about your Mobile device, then Device Info might be the best pick for you. The app provides you detailed information about your Phone’s CPU, Architecture, RAM, Hardware, Sensor, etc.

 
#### 2. CPU X


Well, this is another best Android app on the list that provides you complete information about your phone’s hardware like Processor, cores, speed, RAM, etc. It also tells you about the device model, RAM, Serial number, available sensors, etc. So, CPU X is another best app to check the phone’s processor.

 
#### 3. DevCheck


If you are looking for an Android app to monitor your hardware in real-time and to get complete information about your device, then DevCheck might be the best pick for you. The app gives you detailed information about your device model, CPU, GPU, Memory, Battery, Camera, Disk, Network, Sensors, etc.
So, these are some of the best methods to know the CPU architecture used in your Android smartphone. I hope this article helped you! Share it with your friends also.
