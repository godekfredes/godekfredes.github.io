Revamp Your Windows 10 Start Menu Like A Pro: Here's How To Change The Default Style!

Windows 10 is an iconic operating system that has become synonymous with power and simplicity. One of the most iconic features of this OS is the start menu. It is the go-to place to enter a search query or launch your favorite apps quickly. However, the default start menu style may not be everyone's cup of tea. Luckily, Windows provides various customization options that users can use to tweak their start menu to better suit their interests. In this article, we will elaborate on these customization options and the steps to follow to revamp your Windows 10 start menu like a pro.

Step One: Customize The Start Menu Layout

The first step in transforming your start menu is to tweak the default layout. The default layout involves application icons arranged in alphabetical order, followed by the icon for the power button and your account settings. To customize this layout, right-click on a blank space on the taskbar, and select "Settings." Once there, click on the "Personalization" option.

From there, navigate to the "Start" option, and you will see various options. You can choose to show or hide recently opened apps and the number of apps listed in the start menu. Also, you can choose to show or hide app suggestions and recently added items. Additionally, you can group your pinned apps, which will enable you to organize your applications into relevant categories.

Step Two: Rearrange And Resize Tiles

The second step in revamping your start menu is to step away from the default tile size and layout. Right-click on the tile you want to reposition, and click on "Resize." You can then choose the size you want or revert to the default size.

Also, rearrange the tiles by clicking and dragging them to the desired location. You can group the apps and name them accordingly. For instance, you can group all office-related apps under one label and all entertainment-related lovers under another. This will not only make your start menu look neat, but it will also boost your productivity.

Step Three: Consider Adding Live Tiles

Live tiles are small, dynamic icons that show real-time information about the respective apps. Examples of live tiles include news, weather, calendar, and email updates. To add a live tile, click on the "Start menu tile" that you want on the app list, then click on "Pin to Start." Once you pin it, you will see some of its real-time features in action right on the tile.

Step Four: Color And Theme Customization

The last step in customizing your start menu involves playing around with colors and themes. You can choose from a wide range of colors and tones to help decorate your start menu. To access this feature, navigate to Settings> Personalization> Colors. From there, you can choose to switch to default, custom or high-contrast themes. Furthermore, you can enable transparency, accent colors, and various other color-related options.

Conclusion

Customizing your start menu is an easy and straightforward process that can enhance your user experience dramatically. With a few clicks and a little patience, you can transform your default start menu into an organized, personalized productivity hub. The steps outlined above are a great place to start, but you can always experiment to curate the perfect start menu to suit your style.
