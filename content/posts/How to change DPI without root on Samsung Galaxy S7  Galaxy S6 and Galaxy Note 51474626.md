# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Change DPI on Your Samsung Galaxy Without Root Access!

Have you ever wanted to adjust the DPI or screen density on your Samsung Galaxy but didn't want to go through the hassle of rooting your device? Well, we have some good news for you - changing the DPI on your Samsung Galaxy is easier than you might think, and can be done without rooting your phone.

First of all, let's discuss what exactly DPI means. DPI stands for "dots per inch," and it refers to the number of pixels that are displayed per inch on a screen. When you adjust the DPI on your Samsung Galaxy, you are essentially adjusting the amount of information that is displayed on the screen.

Now, let's get to the good stuff. Here is how you can change the DPI on your Samsung Galaxy without root access:

Step 1: Enable Developer Options

To change the DPI on your Samsung Galaxy, you will need to first enable the Developer Options menu. To do this, go to your phone's Settings app, then scroll down to "About Phone." Next, scroll down to "Software Information" and tap on "Build Number" seven times. You will see a message pop up saying that you are now a developer.

Step 2: Open Developer Options and Find the "Minimum Width" Setting

Once you have enabled Developer Options, go back to the main Settings menu and scroll down to "Developer Options." Find the "Minimum Width" setting and tap on it.

Step 3: Adjust the Minimum Width to Your Desired DPI

In the Minimum Width settings menu, you will see a slider that you can use to adjust the DPI on your Samsung Galaxy. Simply slide the slider to the left or right to increase or decrease the DPI to your desired level.

Step 4: Reboot Your Device

After you have adjusted the DPI to your desired level, it is recommended that you reboot your device to ensure that the changes take effect. To do this, press and hold the power button on your Samsung Galaxy and select "Restart."

That's it! You have now successfully adjusted the DPI on your Samsung Galaxy without root access. You can continue to adjust the DPI as often as you like, and experiment with different levels to find the one that works best for you.

In conclusion, changing the DPI on your Samsung Galaxy without root access is a quick and easy process that can greatly enhance your phone's viewing experience. Give it a try today and see how much of a difference it can make!

Android phones may come with high-resolution displays, but the software screen density on most devices are set so low that it negates any benefit of a higher resolution display. After all, a higher Quad HD resolution display should display more information than a Full HD resolution display.

The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge use the very highest xxxhdpi DPI setting, just like the Nexus 6P. While the default DPI setting on the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge might just be right for most consumers, there are definitely others who are looking to change the DPI of the handset to fit in even more content so as to better utilise the Quad HD display on the handsets.
While there is a way to change the DPI on any Android phone without root, which works on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge as well, it can lead to compatibility issues with some apps. Surprisingly, Samsung has included an option to change the DPI on its latest Galaxies without root. In fact, the company has snuck this option on its 2015 flagship devices — the Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 edge and the Galaxy S6 edge+ — with their Marshmallow update.
So, here is how you can enable this hidden DPI option on your flagship Galaxy device and change its DPI to display more information on the screen.
Step 1: Head over to the Google Play Store and download an app called Display Scaling.
Step 2: Open the app, select the ‘Condensed’ option that will give you a preview of how the content will scale on the screen. If you like the change, tap on Done at the top-right corner of the display.
You can only change the DPI to display more information on the screen and not vice versa. This should not really be an issue, since you can always increase the font size on the handsets if you are having trouble viewing content on the screen at the stock DPI.
