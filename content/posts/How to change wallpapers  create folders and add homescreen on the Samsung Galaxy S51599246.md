# Unlock the Secret to Customizing Your Samsung Galaxy S5 - Master the Art of Changing Wallpapers, Creating Folders, and Enhancing Your Homescreen with These Life-Changing Hacks!

Are you tired of staring at the same old wallpaper on your Samsung Galaxy S5? Do you find it hard to navigate through your apps because you have too many of them cluttered on your home screen? If so, then it's time to unlock the secret to customizing your Galaxy S5 and enhancing your device's overall functionality.

Changing Wallpapers:

The first step to customizing your Galaxy S5 is to change your wallpaper. Simply swiping through your phone's pre-installed wallpapers can be a bit underwhelming, so why not take it up a notch by using your own photos? To do this, first, select your desired photo and then long-press the home screen. This will activate the wallpaper-changing feature, which allows you to crop, rotate, and even add special effects to your chosen image. Don't worry if you're not the best photographer, though - you can easily browse through countless wallpapers online and download them directly to your device.

Creating Folders:

Now that you've spiced up your home screen, it's time to organize your apps. Grouping apps that serve similar functions can save you time and make navigation much easier. To create a folder, long-press on the app icon and once the icon is lifted, drag it onto another app that you want to group together. This will create a folder that you can name and customize as per your preferences.

Enhance Your Homescreen:

To enhance your Galaxy S5's functionality even further, you can use widgets. These are small programs that display information or perform specific functions like controlling your music player or showing your latest tweets. To add a widget, long-press on the home screen and select "Widgets" to browse through the available options.

Another great hack is the use of custom launchers. These are apps that replace your phone's default home screen and often come with more intuitive designs and extra features. Popular launchers like Nova Launcher and Microsoft Launcher offer a host of customization options, from changing the icon pack to adding new gestures.

In conclusion, customizing your Samsung Galaxy S5 is all about making your phone work better for you, and not the other way around. With these simple hacks, you can personalize your device in ways that suit your needs, from changing wallpapers to creating folders, and enhancing your home screen with widgets and custom launchers. So go ahead and unlock the full potential of your Galaxy S5 - it'll change the way you use your phone for the better!

Even though the Galaxy S5 comes with a new version of TouchWiz, it sports the same old launcher as seen on the Note 3 and Galaxy S4. However, since Samsung has replaced the menu key with the Recents key in the Galaxy S5, there is a slight change in the process of changing wallpapers, placing widgets and more on the launcher.
Read below to find out how you can customise the homescreen of your Galaxy S5 without replacing the launcher. 

 
## Changing Wallpapers


To change the wallpaper on your Galaxy S5, simply long press on the home screen and select Wallpapers from the bottom menu that pops up. Now, you can decide whether you want to change the wallpaper of your homescreen, the lockscreen or both. Depending on your choice, the wallpaper picker will open, allowing you to select and apply your favorite image as the wallpaper.


 
## Creating folders


Creating folders on the Galaxy S5 homescreen is slightly different from other Android devices. Instead of dragging ‘n’ dropping an icon on top of another, users will have to long press an icon and then drag it to the Create folder on the top left. You can now give the folder a name as well as add more icons to it.

To customise the icon and background color of a folder, open it, tap the menu overflow button on the top-right and select your desired color.

 
## Adding & Resizing Widgets


To add a new widget on the homescreen of your Galaxy S5, long press on an empty area until the bottom menu pops up. Then, without lifting your finger from the screen, select the Widgets option followed by your desired widget and then drop it in an empty area on your homescreen.
To resize a widget, long press on it until the screen zooms out and drag handles appear on the edges of the widget.

 
## Adding a homescreen


To add a new homescreen on your Galaxy S5, long press on the screen until it zooms out and the bottom menu bar pops up. Then, swipe to the left until you see a giant + sign. Simply tap that symbol to add a new homescreen on your handset.

If you are looking to turn off the My Magazine feature, which is automatically triggered by a right swipe on the homescreen, make sure to read this guide.
