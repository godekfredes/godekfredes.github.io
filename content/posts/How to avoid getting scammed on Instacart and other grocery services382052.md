Are You Falling for These Common Instacart Scams? Learn How to Protect Yourself Now!

Instacart has become the go-to solution for people who want to get their groceries delivered to their doorstep. With its easy-to-use app and friendly user interface, it has become a popular choice among shoppers. However, the convenience comes with a catch. As with any online platform, there are risks of scammers, fraudsters, and hackers looking to take advantage of naive users. Here are some common Instacart scams you should be aware of and how to protect yourself.

1. Fake Store Websites

One of the most common Instacart scams is the fake store website scam. Scammers create a fake website that looks like a legitimate store website, complete with images of products, prices, and even logos of popular retailers. These fraudulent sites offer discounted prices on products and prompt users to check out using their Instacart account. The problem is when users enter their Instacart login details, the scammers capture it and use it for malicious purposes.

Solution: Always verify the retailer's website address before making any transaction. Check if the URL starts with "https," indicating a secure connection. Also, check the store's official website for any discount offers before making any purchase to ensure they are legitimate.

2. Impersonation Scams

Another common Instacart scam involves scammers posing as Instacart shoppers or customer service representatives. They contact users and tell them there is an issue with their account or delivery and request sensitive information like login details, credit card information, or personal information. Once they have the information, they use it to make unauthorized access or transactions.

Solution: Be wary of unsolicited calls or messages from people claiming to be from Instacart. Always check the caller's identity and verify the request through the app or the official Instacart website. Never share any personal or financial information with strangers.

3. Phishing Scams

Phishing scams are attempts by scammers to trick users into providing sensitive information by posing as a trusted entity. They send emails, text messages, or notifications that look like they are from Instacart or a retailer and ask users to click on a link or download an attachment. Once the user clicks on the link or download, the scammer gains access to the user's device, installs malware, or captures their sensitive information.

Solution: Always verify the sender's identity before clicking on any links or downloading any attachments. Look for red flags like grammatical errors or suspicious URLs. Avoid clicking on links from unsolicited emails or messages, and always hover over the URL before clicking to ensure it's legitimate.

4. Payment Scams

Payment scams involve scammers asking users to pay for a delivery in advance or make a refund. They ask for payment through wire transfer, prepaid debit cards, or any other untraceable method. Once the user makes the payment, the scammer disappears, and the user loses their money.

Solution: Instacart doesn't require users to make any payment outside the app. Always check the payment terms before making any transaction and verify that it's from Instacart's official payment gateway. Avoid making payments through untraceable methods or sending money to individuals you don't know.

Conclusion

Instacart has become a popular platform for grocery delivery. With its convenience, came scammers looking to take advantage of unsuspecting users. But knowing the common Instacart scams and how to protect yourself can help save you from potential losses. Always verify any requests, suspicious transactions, or websites before making any transaction, and report any suspicious activity to Instacart's customer service immediately to protect your account and personal information.

As with any service, though, more moving parts means more chances for things to go wrong. And now, people waiting on grocery deliveries have encountered scammers who make off with their food and money without ever bringing it. If you plan on ordering groceries, here’s what you need to do to protect yourself.

This comes after an apparent 60% surge in demand, which has now snarled grocery deliveries to the point where they take several days to arrive. Tap or click here to see the proper way to disinfect the food you order.
And when business booms, scammers also look for opportunities to sneak in and make a quick buck. Customers for companies like Instacart are also experiencing slowdowns in their deliveries, but that’s not the only thing going wrong. Some have also reported scam-shoppers that buy their groceries and disappear without a trace.
On The Kim Komando Show, Kim spoke with her friend Jackie, who experienced this exact scam. While communicating with the shopper during checkout, the person mysteriously vanished. During her communications with him, he seemed strangely quiet and mentioned that certain items were “out of stock” despite Jackie knowing better.
Jackie waited hours for her food to arrive, but the person never came by with her delivery. It seems, somehow, he made off with her order and disappeared. After that, she spent more than an hour on hold with Instacart support to get her order rectified. 
Needless to say, Jackie isn’t alone. The Better Business Bureau has seen numerous scam reports and complaints from dissatisfied customers, with a big spike from mid-March through April.
When times turn desperate, it’s not uncommon for theft to spike. And with food shortages happening across several cities, one can expect this kind of scam to keep happening.

 
## Pay safe, stay safe


If your delivery order suddenly vanishes on you, you don’t have to be a victim. Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself and your money:

 
Avoid paying for Instacart directly with your credit card. Instead, choose Paypal as your preferred way to pay, since Paypal can help you resolve any money issues much faster than Instacart’s customer service. Tap or click here to find out more about Paypal and other safe ways to pay online.Stay in communication with your delivery person throughout the experience, and write down their name. You may be asked to provide it in the event of a dispute.Try to keep your orders simple, and avoid vague measurements and quantities that could confuse the delivery person (or give them an opportunity to steal). As an example, ask for a pre-filled bag of potatoes rather than potatoes by the pound, since it’d be much easier for them to “skim off the top” and take some without you noticing.In spite of everything, be courteous to your delivery-person. They’re facing significant dangers by venturing outdoors in public spaces and risking viral exposure. The work they’re doing is helping people like us flatten the curve and maintain social distancing. 


If delivery doesn’t feel worth the risk to you, there’s always the option to go shopping yourself. You’re increasing your chance for viral exposure, as stated above, but with protective gear and some basic precautions, you can reduce your risk considerably:
