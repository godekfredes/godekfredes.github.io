# Unlock Secret Samsung Galaxy S5 Notification Panel Tricks That Will Blow Your Mind - Learn To Customise Your Interface Like A Pro!

The Samsung Galaxy S5 is a highly customizable smartphone with a wealth of features and capabilities that can make your life easier when it comes to productivity, entertainment, and more. One of the most significant features of this device is the notification panel, which is your go-to tool for finding information about incoming messages, emails, notifications, and more. In this article, we will explore some secret Samsung Galaxy S5 notification panel tricks that can blow your mind and help you customise your interface like a pro.

## Trick #1: Quick Settings

The Quick Settings menu is a great way to get fast access to some of the more commonly used features on your phone. By swiping down on the notification panel with two fingers, you can access a range of settings like Bluetooth, WiFi, Location, and more. However, did you know that you can also customise the Quick Settings menu?

To do this, swipe down on the notification panel, tap the edit icon, and then drag and drop the settings to your desired location in the Quick Settings bar.

## Trick #2: Blocking Mode

Do you get distracted by your phone's notifications when you're supposed to be asleep? The Blocking Mode feature can help you prevent unwanted notifications during times when you don't want to be disturbed. To activate it, swipe down on the notification panel, tap the gear icon, and then select Blocking Mode. From there, you can choose to enable or disable various features that can be blocked during the specified time period.

## Trick #3: One-Handed Mode

Sometimes, it's tough to use your phone with one hand, especially if you have a larger device like the Samsung Galaxy S5. Fortunately, the One-Handed Mode feature can make it easier to use your phone with one hand. To activate this feature, go to Settings, choose Display and then One-Handed Mode. From there, you can select which side of the screen you want to shrink down to make it easier to reach all parts of the phone with one hand.

## Trick #4: Smart Dual SIM

The Samsung Galaxy S5 also has a Smart Dual SIM feature that can simplify the way you use two SIM cards. This feature allows you to easily switch between two SIM cards, so you can use different plans for work and personal use, for example. To activate this feature, go to Settings, choose SIM Card Manager and then Dual SIM. From there, you can select which SIM card you want to use as your primary SIM, and which one you want to use for data only.

The Samsung Galaxy S5 notification panel has several hidden features that can make your life easier and help you get more out of your device. By using these tricks, you can customise your interface like a pro and make the most of your smartphone experience. Whether you're looking for ways to save time or stay productive, the Samsung Galaxy S5 has some great tools and features that can help you do just that.

Even though the Galaxy S5 comes with Quick Settings, its notification panel is quite populated with access to some frequently used toggles, a brightness slider and shortcuts to some commonly used apps. As always though, Samsung provides users with a way to customise the toggles — add, remove or re-position them — as well as remove certain items from the panel. Here’s how.

Step 1: On your home screen, use the two finger gesture and swipe down from the top to bring up the Quick Settings menu. Then, tap the pencil icon to enter the Notification Panel settings. Alternatively, you can also access it by going to Settings and tapping the Notification panel option located under Sound and Display.

Step 2: Under the “Set quick setting buttons” list, you will see two set of categories: Active buttons and Available buttons. Here, you can drag ‘n’ drop the active buttons into the available buttons list and vice versa to disable or enable them. You can also move them around via the same process.
Keep in mind that there is no way to completely remove all the toggles from the notification panel. You must have at least 5 toggles, whether you like them or not. You can also remove the brightness adjustment slider present in the notification panel from this menu.

If you insert headphones into the 3.5mm jack on the S5, you will notice a small list of apps comes up on the notification panel. You can customise this panel from Quick settings as well. Just tap the Recommended apps option, which will give you access to the list of apps that show up in the panel when a headphone is plugged in. You can either customise this list now or disable it completely by toggling the switch present in the action bar. Sadly, there is no way to completely disable or remove the S Finder and Quick connect shortcuts present in the notification panel.
Do you find the crowded notification bar in the Galaxy S5 useful or absolutely loathe it? Drop in a comment and let us know!
