Are you curious about your credit score? It's an important number that determines your ability to obtain credit cards, loans, and mortgages. Knowing your credit score can help you make informed decisions and unlock the secrets of your financial future. Luckily, checking your credit score is easy and can be done from the comfort of your own home. In this article, we will show you the simple trick to check your credit score now.

Firstly, it's important to understand what a credit score is and how it is calculated. A credit score is a number that lenders use to determine your creditworthiness. The most commonly used credit score is known as a FICO score, which ranges from 300-850. The higher your credit score, the better your credit history and the more likely you are to be approved for credit with favorable terms and interest rates. 

Credit scores are calculated based on several factors, including your payment history, credit utilization, length of credit history, types of credit used, and new credit inquiries. Your payment history is the most important factor when calculating your credit score, as it shows how reliably you pay your bills on time. Your credit utilization is another important factor, as it measures the amount of credit you are currently using compared to your credit limits. 

Now that you know what a credit score is and how it's calculated, let's discuss the simple trick to check your credit score. The easiest way to check your credit score is by using a credit monitoring service. There are many free and paid credit monitoring services available, such as Credit Karma, Credit Sesame, and MyFICO. These services allow you to view your credit score and credit report at any time, as well as receive alerts about changes to your credit history, such as new accounts or late payments. 

To use a credit monitoring service, simply sign up and provide some basic information, such as your name, address, and social security number. The service will then pull your credit report and calculate your credit score. This process typically takes only a few minutes and you'll be able to view your score immediately. 

Aside from using a credit monitoring service, you can also obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus - Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion - once per year at AnnualCreditReport.com. While this report does not include your credit score, it provides detailed information about your credit history and can be used to identify any errors or inaccuracies that may be negatively affecting your score. 

In conclusion, checking your credit score is easy and essential for unlocking the secrets of your financial future. By knowing your credit score and credit history, you can make informed decisions about borrowing and managing your finances. Use the simple trick we provided to check your credit score today and take control of your financial future.

Knowing your credit score helps you see what prospective lenders see. That way, you have a realistic idea of what kind of financing product you're eligible for and whether now is a wise time to finance more expensive items.

Meanwhile, you're in luck if you're establishing or rebuilding your credit. You can get a secured credit card with many lenders offering these monitoring services, such as Capital One and Discover. How this works is you make a deposit that becomes your credit limit. And when you open one, you gain access to these monitoring tools.

Other credit card companies offering similar perks include Bank of America, U.S. Bank, Citi, Wells Fargo, Barclay, and American Express. 
Another option is Credit Sesame, which is also a free service to use. You'll receive your VantageScore from TransUnion with daily updates. They also provide transaction alerts, allowing you to determine the validity of the information entered onto your TransUnion credit report. And if that information is inaccurate, you can get on top of it to dispute it before it causes any more harm. Another convenient feature is credit offers and approval odds. 
You could also use a service like myFico. myFico grants you access to your Equifax credit score with monthly updates. Further, a paid subscription unlocks credit scores from all three bureaus and FICO score versions for mortgages and auto loans. Therefore, if you're in a position to buy a home or vehicle soon, the paid membership helps you learn where you stand before you apply to prospective lenders. 
Meanwhile, credit monitoring services often need your name, address, and last four digits of your Social Security number. Because you're entering your personal information, try to use a private connection when setting up and accessing your account. Public WiFi makes it easier for your information to become compromised. 
Another difference resides in the criteria measured to determine the score. With FICO, your payment history is 35% responsible for your score, while 30% consists of the balances owed on your accounts. Comparatively, VantageScore places a higher weight on credit usage, balances, and how much available credit you have on your revolving lines. Say you have a credit card with a $1,000 limit; if your balance is $900, it'll drop your score since, you're using most of your credit line. 
Combining all factors, FICO assigns a score from a low of 300 to a high of 850. VantageScore uses the same scoring range as FICO.
