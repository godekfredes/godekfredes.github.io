Revolutionize Your Browsing Experience with This Automatic Profile Switching Trick for Microsoft Edge!

With the ever-increasing amount of time we spend browsing the internet, it has become a necessity to streamline our browsing habits for efficiency and convenience. Microsoft Edge, the default browser for Windows users, offers a unique feature that allows you to create multiple profiles, each with its own set of customized settings, bookmarks, and extensions. However, switching between profiles manually can be a tedious process.

Fortunately, Microsoft Edge has a trick up its sleeve that can save you time and effort by automatically switching between profiles based on the website you are visiting. Here's how you can revolutionize your browsing experience with this automatic profile switching trick:

Step 1: Create Multiple Profiles in Microsoft Edge

Firstly, you need to create multiple profiles in Microsoft Edge. To do this, open Edge and click on your profile picture in the top-right corner of the window. From the dropdown menu, select "Manage profiles" and click "Add profile" to create a new one. You can repeat this process to create as many profiles as you need, each with a unique name and avatar.

Step 2: Assign Websites to Specific Profiles

Next, you need to assign specific websites to each of your profiles. To do this, click on your profile picture again and select "Settings". Scroll down to the "Profiles" section, and click "Add a site to this profile". Type in the URL of the website you want to assign to this profile, select the appropriate profile from the dropdown menu, and click "Add".

Repeat this process for all the websites you want to assign to each of your profiles. It's that simple!

Step 3: Enjoy Automatic Profile Switching

Now that you've assigned websites to each of your profiles, Microsoft Edge will automatically switch to the appropriate profile when you visit the assigned website. For example, if you assigned Facebook to your "Personal" profile and Twitter to your "Work" profile, Edge will switch to the corresponding profile when you visit each site.

This can save you a lot of time and effort, especially if you regularly alternate between different websites for work and personal use. You no longer have to manually switch profiles every time you visit a different website - Edge does it for you!

Conclusion

In conclusion, Microsoft Edge's automatic profile switching feature can revolutionize your browsing experience by streamlining the way you browse different websites. By assigning specific websites to each of your profiles, Edge automatically switches to the appropriate profile, saving you time and effort.

Each of the Microsoft Edge browser profiles will have different account information, history, favorites, passwords, and a few other things. Recently, while using Microsoft edge, we discovered a hidden profile management feature called auto-switch for profiles. It’s a profile management feature that switches between profiles automatically.

 
### How does the Auto-Switch for Profile Work?


Basically, if you have multiple profiles on your Edge browser, the web browser will ask if you want to switch to a different profile while visiting new websites. Once you select the profile, the Edge browser remembers your selection and automatically switches to your specific profile when you revisit those sites in the future.
So, if Microsoft Edge detects that a link is a personal or work link, the browser will automatically prompt you to switch to the appropriate profile. The feature could also be very handy for those who use the same device & profile for work and entertainment purposes; since they will be able to better ensure that they are not wasting time on their work profile.
