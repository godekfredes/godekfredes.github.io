Title: You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Block Sensitive Instagram Content - Find Out Here!

Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms, with over one billion active users worldwide. People share all kinds of content on this app, ranging from pictures of cute pets to provocative images that might make some users uncomfortable. Instagram has taken steps to moderate content, but it's not foolproof. In this article, we will show you how easy it is to block sensitive Instagram content.

Instagram provides users with many options to block content they don't want to see. If you're using the mobile app, you can find these options by tapping the three lines in the top right corner, selecting the settings icon on the bottom right, then tapping Privacy > Sensitive Content Control. On the desktop site, go to your profile and click on the three lines in the top right corner, then click Settings > Privacy > Sensitive Content Control.

Once you're in the Sensitive Content Control menu, you can choose to either limit sensitive content or completely block it. The limit option will merely blur out sensitive content while still allowing you to see it if you tap on it. The block option, on the other hand, will completely hide any sensitive content, even if you tap on it.

Instagram defines sensitive content as something that "goes against their community standards on nudity or sexual activity, violence and gore, and drugs." However, Instagram can't police all the sensitive content that is uploaded by users. So, if you want to make sure you never come across any such content, it's recommended to block it altogether.

Instagram is also rolling out a new feature to give users more control over the content they see. The new "Sensitive Content Control" feature allows Instagram users to decide on the amount of sensitive content they want to see on their Explore page. This feature is being introduced to help those who might be sensitive to explicit content.

In conclusion, if you're someone who is sensitive to provocative content, Instagram makes it easy for you to block it. By following the steps outlined above, you can take control of your feed and enjoy a more comfortable Instagram experience. Remember that social media platforms can't always catch every piece of sensitive content, so it's essential to take personal responsibility and make use of the tools offered to you by the platform.

Since Instagram is mainly used to share photos & videos, it’s also a house of sensitive content. You can find both useful and offensive/sensitive content on Instagram’s Explore tab.
