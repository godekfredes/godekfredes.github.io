# Say Goodbye to Your Lame Reddit Username: The Ultimate Guide For Changing Your Username in 2022!

Are you tired of using a lame username on Reddit? Do you want to change it but don't know how? Don't worry, because we've got you covered. In this ultimate guide, we'll show you how to change your Reddit username so that you can finally have a name that you're proud of. 

Reddit is an incredibly popular platform that allows users to share news, stories, memes, and just about anything under the sun. However, when signing up for an account, the username that you choose is permanent and cannot be edited. This means that if you ended up with a username that you don't like, you're stuck with it forever. Or at least, that's what you thought.

Luckily, Reddit has recently rolled out its new feature that allows users to change their usernames. With this feature, you can finally say goodbye to your lame Reddit username and create a new one that embodies your online identity. Here's how you can change your username in a few easy steps. 

## Step 1: Go to Your Reddit Account Settings

To start, you need to log in to your Reddit account and navigate to your account settings. Look for the "User Settings" option on the top right-hand corner of the screen, and click on it. This will take you to your account preferences, where you can see all the settings related to your Reddit account.

## Step 2: Click on the "Profile" Tab

Once you're in your account settings, you need to click on the "Profile" tab. This tab contains all the settings related to your profile, including your username, bio, and profile picture. 

## Step 3: Look for the "Username" Field

In the "Profile" tab, look for the "Username" field. This is where your current username is displayed. Click on the "Edit" button next to your username to change it. 

## Step 4: Create a New Username

After clicking on the "Edit" button, you can now create a new username. Type in the name you want to use and check if it's available. Reddit will automatically tell you if the name is taken, so you can choose another one if needed. 

## Step 5: Save Changes

Once you've chosen your new username, click on the "Save" button. Reddit will ask you to confirm the change, so make sure that you're happy with your new name before clicking on "Yes, Change My Username."

## Step 6: Enjoy Your New Username

Congratulations, you have successfully changed your Reddit username! You can now log out and log back in to see your new name in action. Enjoy your new username, and use it to make your mark on the Reddit community. 

## Final Thoughts

Changing your Reddit username is now easier than ever, thanks to the platform's new feature. With just a few clicks, you can finally say goodbye to your lame username and embrace a new one that represents your true online persona. Just remember to choose a name that you'll be happy with for a long time. Happy Redditing!

The site is very useful, and if you are actively using it, you may know that it assigns a generic username by default. If you haven’t set the username, you have the option to change it, but a few criteria should match.

### Difference between Reddit Username & Display Name


Well, the Display name on Reddit is the one that appears on your profile page; you can change it many times. On the other hand, the Username is the one that looks unique and appears on your posts, comments, and replies. You can change your username only once.
If you’ve used your email address to sign up for a Reddit account, you will have the option to change the username during the account creation process. Once the account is created, there’s no way to change the username again.
However, Reddit assigns a random username when you use your Google or Apple account to sign up. Hence, after creating an account via Google or Apple account, you will have the option to change the username. But the criteria is that you can only change the username within 30 days of account creation.

 
## Steps to Change Your Reddit Username & Display Name


If the 30 days have passed, the username will stay with your account permanently. Here’s how you can change your Reddit username.

 
### 1) Change Reddit Username in Mobile


If you have just created a new Reddit account, you will have the option to change the username during the account creation process. Use your email address to sign up, and when Reddit randomly assigns you a username, you need to add your own.

If you have already created a Reddit account using Google or Apple, follow some of the simple steps we have shared below.
1. Open the Reddit app on your Android/iOS device.

2. Next, sign in to the account whose username you want to change. Next, tap on your profile avatar in the top right corner.

3. From the menu that slides in, tap on the My Profile option.

4. If you have created the account within 30 days, you will see a prompt asking you to change the username. Tap on the prompt and set your new username.
That’s it! If you don’t see the prompt, you can’t change your username on the Reddit app for Android.

 
### 2) Change the Display Name on Reddit App


Well, even if you can’t change the Reddit username, you can change the display name. Here’s how you can change the Display name on Reddit.
1. Open the Reddit app and click on your profile avatar in the top-right corner.

2. From the menu that appears tap on the My profile.

3. On your Reddit profile page, tap on the Edit Profile button.

4. Under the display name, enter the name you want to use. Once done, tap on the Save button.

That’s it! The new display name will reflect on your Reddit profile page.
