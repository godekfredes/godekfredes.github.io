Title: Unlock Google's Hidden Secrets: The Ultimate Guide to Bringing Back View Image and Search by Image Buttons!

Introduction:
Google is a powerful search engine that has helped people find the answers to their questions, the right products to buy, and the images they need. However, in 2018, Google removed two of its most popular buttons - View Image and Search by Image - which made it difficult for users to quickly download or search for an image. But the good news is that there are ways to bring back these buttons and improve your Google image search experience. In this ultimate guide, we will show you how to unlock Google's hidden secrets and get these buttons back!

Step 1: Install a View Image Extension
One way to bring back the View Image button is by installing a browser extension. These are tools that you can add to your browser to help customize your online experience. There are several extensions available for download that can help you restore the View Image button. One of the most popular is View Image, which is available for Chrome and Firefox. All you need to do is download and install the extension, and it will automatically restore the View Image button to your Google image search results.

Step 2: Use a Search by Image Website
Another alternative to the Search by Image button is to use a dedicated website that provides the same functionality. With these websites, you can upload an image or enter an image URL and then search for similar or identical images on the internet. Some of the popular search by image websites include TinEye, Google Reverse Image Search, and Bing Image Match. These websites are easy to use and can help you quickly find the images you are looking for.

Step 3: Bookmark a View Image URL
If you don't want to download an extension or use a search by image website, you can also create a bookmark that will bring back the View Image button. All you need to do is add a bookmark to your browser's bookmarks bar with the following URL: javascript:void((function(){var%20a,b,c,d,e;e=document.getElementsByTagName('img');for(b=0;b<e.length;++b){a=e[b];if(a.hasAttribute('data-src')){d=a.getAttribute('data-src');}else{d=a.src;}c=document.createElement('a');c.href=d;c.setAttribute('download','');if(a.hasAttribute('title')){c.setAttribute('title',a.getAttribute('title'));}c.appendChild(a.cloneNode(true));a.parentNode.replaceChild(c,a);}})());. Once added, click on the bookmark whenever you want to use the View Image button.

Conclusion:
Google's image search feature has become even more powerful with these tools and tricks to bring back the View Image and Search by Image buttons. Whether you choose to install an extension, use a search by image website, or create a bookmark, these methods are all easy to use and will help you find the images you need. Unlock the hidden secrets of Google and enjoy a better image search experience!

In this day and age of third-party tools, I don’t think it is. Following the announcement, developers have come forward and brought both of those features back to life. In addition to that, if you know your way around Google, you can still easily access both of them officially, albeit with an extra step. Here’s how.

 
### Access the “View Image” and “Search By Image” Buttons on Google Without any Third-Party Tool



The official workaround is quite straightforward. Instead of making use of the “View Image” button, you can simply click the image once, fire up the context menu (right-click on it), and hit “Open Image in a new tab” or “View Image” or whatever your browser’s equivalent is. That’s about it. You now have access to the full-size picture without loading the source website.

For performing a search with an image you came across on Google as the input, all you need to do is drag and drop it in the search bar rather than clicking the dedicated button.

 
### Bring Back the View Image and Search By Image Buttons on Google


If you are one of those people who are too accustomed to the old buttons and find right-clicking a bit of an exercise, we have a solution for you as well.

You guys will have to download and install a little third-party tool on your browsers for resurrecting the “View Image” and “Search by Image” buttons. It’s available for both Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. The extension functions as you’d expect and places both the options back where they used to be. It’s entirely free of cost as well and measures merely 30KB in size.
