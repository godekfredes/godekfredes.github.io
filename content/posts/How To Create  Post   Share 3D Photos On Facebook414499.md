Once you've uploaded your photo, you can edit it by adding depth or changing the focus point. Facebook has built-in editing tools that allow you to adjust the position and size of the foreground and background layers.

Step 4: Share!

Once you've edited your photo to your liking, it's time to share! Your 3D photo will be displayed as a post on your newsfeed. Your friends and family can view it by moving their phone or by scrolling through the image.
