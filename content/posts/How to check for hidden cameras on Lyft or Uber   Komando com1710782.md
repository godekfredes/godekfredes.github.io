# Is Your Uber Driver Spying on You? Learn How to Spot Hidden Cameras Today!

Ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft have made getting around town an excellently convenient task. With just a swipe of your smartphone, you can summon a ride to your location with little hassle. But while ride-hailing platforms are designed to guarantee safety, some riders may question whether their travel is being tracked by hidden cameras or not.

As a rider, safety and privacy are essential, which is why it is worth understanding whether or not your Uber driver is spying on you. While drivers need to check out of the ride-hailing network if they want to purposely record their passengers, it is easy, inexpensive, and possible for them to mount hidden cameras in their vehicles, which is why you should still be cautious.

In this guide, we'll explain how you can identify hidden cameras and clarify whether your driver is spying on you.

## Why Would Uber Drivers Spy on You?

Before we delve into finding hidden cameras, let's discuss why Uber drivers would want to spy on their passengers? Many drivers utilize dashcams for general safety purposes. Still, some drivers who are seeking to gather proof against passengers' dishonesty or evidence for a car accident, among other things, may utilize hidden cameras.

There have been reports about Uber drivers who are careful of getting sued by passengers for alleged inappropriate conduct or other things. Thus, it's reasonable to conclude that ensuring trustworthy ride experiences is required for the drivers.

## How to Detect Hidden Cameras in Your Uber Ride?

For casual riders, it might not always be evident whether you're being monitored or not. Below are the top ways to detect hidden cameras and ensure your privacy is safe from unauthorized eyes:

1. Look at any unusual objects or positions.

Always be conscious of your surrounding as you climb into the car since small details can make it easy to detect the hidden camera. Watch out for anything unusual, like a hole in a plush toy or a place where you suspect something to be hidden.

2. Trust Your Instincts

If you're in the cab, and you feel something odd, that probably means something isn't right. You're riding with a stranger and should be sensitive to your intuition. If you think you're being watched or something else is strange, cancel your ride and ask for another.

3. Keep Your Eyes Open

When you are relaxing in the car, take a quick look around you, and don't be afraid to scrutinize suspicious spots. Inspect for cameras in common hiding spots, such as in side mirrors and rearview mirrors.

4. Use available gadgets

Use your technology before you enter the car: Uber's app provides details on the car model, driver's name and picture, and plate number. This information will help to confirm whether the ride request you made is the same car and driver that arrive.

Moreover, if you're suspicious, use your cell phone's flashlight to look into any obscured places, such as case vents or behind any upholstery.

## Final Thoughts

The debate revolving around an Uber driver's right to use video surveillance and track the rider's behavior continues. However, all passengers have the right to expect basic privacy when they enter an Uber. It is encouraged to talk to your driver before the ride starts to confirm that they have not installed any hidden cameras in their vehicle. And it doesn't hurt to be vigilant for hidden cameras during the ride. By using the tips covered in this article, you can evade privacy violations and stay safe while using Uber.

Some drivers use cameras as a security measure (something often found in taxi company cars), but the St. Louis driver shared the video online for viewers to comment on. His actions were legal in Missouri, a one-party recording consent state, but the passengers were horrified to learn their every word and action inside the car was live-streamed to strangers.
While Lyft announced it had deactivated the driver and Uber said it ended its relationship with him, we’re all now very aware of the potential privacy issues surrounding cameras in ride-sharing cars. The St. Louis driver isn’t an isolated case. Other Uber and Lyft drivers have done the same, though some had a practice of telling their passengers first.
Hidden cameras could still be a problem, but there are some steps you can take to identify the use of cameras in an Uber or Lyft vehicle.

 
### What to look for


The now-suspended St. Louis driver had a small sticker on his car warning passengers of security cameras on board and telling them they were consenting to be recorded by entering into the vehicle. The sticker did not mention the online broadcasting aspect of the system and passengers who talked to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said they did not notice the sticker. Look out for a similar notice on any Uber or Lyft vehicle you are planning to ride in.

The next place to check is the dashboard. Most camera systems will mount on the dash in order to get a view of the driver and the people in the back seat. Don’t hesitate to talk to your driver before you get in and ask if there are any cameras in operation in the car.
Uber’s official policy is to allow its drivers to install and use video cameras to “record riders for purposes of safety.” It also warns drivers that local regulations may require them to fully disclose this and obtain consent. Lyft tells its drivers to comply with their city and state’s regulations when it comes to recording devices. It says some locations may not allow recording devices at all, while others may require signage.

### What to do


You can ask the driver if the cameras are simply for security use or if the video is being broadcast for other purposes. If you feel comfortable with the response, then you can choose to ride. Keep in mind that privacy in an Uber or Lyft is not guaranteed and conduct yourself accordingly. This isn’t the time to spill personal secrets or vent about your boss.

You can also ask the driver to turn off any cameras. The driver may or may not choose to honor this request. Some drivers insist on the cameras in order to protect themselves in case of disputes or unruly passengers. If you’re not comfortable, then request a different driver.
The live-streaming incident should make Uber and Lyft users more wary about their use of ride-shares. Just remember you can refuse a ride in an Uber or Lyft if you have privacy concerns about cameras in the vehicle.
