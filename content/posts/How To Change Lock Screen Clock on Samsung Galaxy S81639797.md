# Revamp Your Samsung Galaxy S8 Lock Screen Clock in Just 3 Simple Steps!

Are you tired of staring at the same boring lock screen clock on your Samsung Galaxy S8? Do you want to customize it with a more stylish and functional design? If so, you've come to the right place. In this article, we'll show you how to revamp your Samsung Galaxy S8 lock screen clock in just three simple steps.

## Step 1: Download a Clock Widget

The first step in revamping your lock screen clock is to download a clock widget. There are many clock widgets available on the Google Play Store, but we recommend the "Minimalist Clock Widget" by Devmil. This widget is minimalist, elegant, and highly customizable.

To download the widget, open the Google Play Store, search for "Minimalist Clock Widget," and install it on your Samsung Galaxy S8.

## Step 2: Set the Clock Widget as the Lock Screen Clock

Once you've downloaded the clock widget, it's time to set it as the lock screen clock. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Samsung Galaxy S8's home screen.
2. Press and hold on an empty area of the screen to bring up the Home screen settings.
3. Tap "Widgets" at the bottom of the screen.
4. Scroll down and find the "Minimalist Clock Widget" widget.
5. Press and hold on the widget and then drag it to your lock screen.

Now, you should see the clock widget on your lock screen. But, it might not be in the right place or size, so let's move to the next step.

## Step 3: Customize the Clock Widget

The final step in revamping your lock screen clock is to customize the clock widget according to your preferences. The "Minimalist Clock Widget" is highly customizable, and you can change the font, color, size, and other options. To customize the widget, follow these steps:

1. Press and hold on the clock widget on your lock screen.
2. Tap the "Widget Settings" button.
3. Use the various options to customize the widget according to your preferences.

For example, you can choose a bigger or smaller clock, pick a new font, select different colors for various parts of the clock or change the clock format altogether. Once you are satisfied, just hit the "Save" button, and you're done! You can now lock your phone and unlock it again to see the beautiful new clock on your lock screen.

Conclusion

In just three simple steps, you can revamp your Samsung Galaxy S8 lock screen clock with a beautiful and highly customizable clock widget. Download the "Minimalist Clock Widget" from the Google Play Store, set it as your lock screen clock, and customize it to your preferences using the widget settings. With a new lock screen clock, you'll never have to stare at the same old boring design again!

If the Galaxy S8 or the Galaxy S8+ is your first Android smartphone, it is likely that you will be overwhelmed with the sheer number of features that the handset comes with. A frequent question that I have seen many new Galaxy S8 owners ask is how to change the lock screen clock.

Now, unlike other Android devices, there are two different lock screen clocks that one can be talking about here. First, there is the Always On Display, which is enabled by default on the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Taking advantage of the OLED display, Samsung offers an Always On Display mode on the Galaxy S8 in which the display will show the time and an unread notification icon from a few selected apps.
Now, if you want to customise this lock screen clock, that can be done from the Settings menu. However, if you want to customise the clock on the ‘actual’ lock screen i.e. on the screen that shows up when you wake up the device and you are yet to unlock the device, well that’s not possible sadly. While previous versions of Android featured lock screen widgets, it is not possible to add additional widgets on the S8’s lock screen. One has to make do with the four widgets that Samsung has placed on the lock screen by default: clock, music, calendar, and alarm. By default, the lock screen will automatically switch to the clock widget and one has to swipe to the left to access the other widgets.
If you want, you can disable the additional ‘FaceWidgets’ or re-order them as well. For this, head over to Settings -> Lock screen and Security -> FaceWidgets.

Nonetheless, if all you want to do is change the clock style on the Always On Display of your Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8+, here’s how to do so.
Step 1: Head over to Settings -> Lock screen and Security -> Always On Display. 
Step 2: You can now customise Always On Display according to your liking. This includes being able to change the lock screen clock style to world clock or an analogue one or even switch to Edge clock. Additionally, you can also set the Always On Display to show a custom image or the calendar.
Remember that using the Always On Display will have a negative impact on the battery life of your Galaxy S8 or S8+. So, it is recommended that you turn the feature off if you want to prolong the battery of your handset. You can also automatically turn on Always On Display when the phone is charging via an app.
If you are not really fond of the stock lock screen on the Galaxy S8, you can try a third-party replacement app from the Play Store. But remember that they won’t play well with the iris scanner and will also act finicky at times.
