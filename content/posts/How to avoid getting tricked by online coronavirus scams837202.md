Title: Secret Revealed: Foolproof Ways To Outsmart and Avoid Online Coronavirus Scams!

The outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) has brought chaos and confusion to the world, and scammers have taken advantage of this. With many people stuck at home and relying heavily on technology for information and essential services, scammers are taking advantage of their vulnerability to defraud them. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Americans have lost over $13 million to coronavirus-related fraud. In this article, we will discuss foolproof ways to outsmart and avoid online coronavirus scams.

1. Be wary of unknown links and attachments.

Cybercriminals exploit uncertainty and fear, and one common way they do this is by sending unsolicited links and attachments. Clicking on these links or downloading attachments can result in malware attacks. To avoid this, be cautious when opening emails or social media messages from unknown sources. Always verify the sender's email address and avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments that seem suspicious.

2. Use official sources of information.

Scammers create fake websites and social media accounts that emulate official sources of information, such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). These fake websites are designed to trick individuals into providing personal and financial information. To avoid this, it is essential to use official sources of information to obtain updates on the coronavirus outbreak. Official sources can be trusted, as they provide accurate and relevant information on the pandemic.

3. Protect your personal and financial information.

Scammers may reach out to individuals via email or phone, claiming to be healthcare professionals or government officials. They may ask for personal or financial information, such as Social Security numbers or credit card details. It is crucial to protect personal and financial information by never sharing sensitive information with unknown sources. Legitimate healthcare professionals and government officials would not ask for personal or financial information via email or phone.

4. Keep devices and software up to date.

Keeping devices, software, and applications up to date is one of the best ways to avoid online scams. Scammers exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software to launch attacks. To avoid this, ensure that your devices, software, and applications are updated regularly.

In conclusion, scammers are exploiting the coronavirus outbreak to defraud unsuspecting individuals. To outsmart and avoid online coronavirus scams, it is essential to be wary of unknown links and attachments, use official sources of information, protect personal and financial information, and keep devices, software, and applications up to date. By following these foolproof ways, you can protect yourself and your loved ones from coronavirus-related online scams.


Of course, now is not the time to panic. Panic will only lead to deeper problems in affected countries — such as food hoarding and medical supply shortages. Throw fearmongering and fake news into the mix and you have a recipe for disaster. Tap or click to see some of the wildest fake coronavirus stories.
To make matters worse, scammers and con artists are finding their times to shine amid the epidemic. When uncertainty rules the atmosphere, these scummy grifters make it their mission to rip people off. To stay safe, you’ll need to know which scams to watch out for.

 
## 1. Email scams and phishing schemes


Email scams are one of the most basic weapons in a scammer’s arsenal. They’re easy ways to spread malicious links to phishing sites and malware, and they serve as the perfect vehicles for malicious attachments that can harm your computer.
Thanks to the spread of the coronavirus, email scams are masquerading as disease control authorities. Fake bulletins pretending to be from the CDC and other relevant agencies are common, as are deceptive pages that look like the real organization websites.
According to reports from Business Insider, a common CDC phishing scam spreading right now includes links to “updated case lists” that actually direct you to malicious sites where you will be asked for your email login. 
These often employ realistic-sounding language and convey a sense of urgency. Most of the time, the people running these scams aren’t even Americans. Tap or click to see what Russian scammers think of the coronavirus.
If you get an email pretending to be from one of these organizations, avoid clicking any links or attachments. To check the legitimacy of these emails, always check the senders’ email addresses to see if they match up to a .gov domain. If they don’t, they’re likely fakes.
You can always right-click and copy the links in these emails then paste them into a Word document to see if they look trustworthy. If they’re just long jumbles of characters or don’t redirect to a .gov site, you can promptly ignore them. 

 
## 2. Forget coronavirus, here’s a computer virus


Earlier this year, Japanese netizens discovered an email scam containing a PDF file with lists of “updated local infections.” As it turned out, these attachments were nothing more than trojan malware that harvested personal data. 
Once your system is infected, the trojan lingers and continues to pose a risk of further malicious activity. As mentioned above, make sure not to open any attachments from unknown senders under any circumstances. Tap or click for more information about this trojan.

## 3. Digital snake oil


When disaster strikes, people will often fall victim to bogus products that prey on their fears and anxieties. And leave it to the modern snake-oil salesmen of the world to take advantage of a global health crisis. 
A number of phony health products ranging from essential oils to healing crystals were an epidemic on platforms like Facebook. Fortunately, the company banned further sales of products that claimed to treat or cure the virus. Tap or click to see what prompted its decision.
But aside from Facebook, other platforms like Craigslist and Etsy are still hotbeds for phony viral cures. If you’re thinking about picking up a hand-crocheted sick mask or a hazmat suit for babies, keep in mind that COVID-19 has no known cure and a vaccine is likely still months away. 
Many of these platforms aren’t going to self-moderate, so it’s up to you to use your best judgment. Tap or click here to see the coronavirus gear scams circulating around online marketplaces.

 
## 4. Price-gouging and other rip-offs


Con artists are keenly aware of what fear will push people to do. As a result, they stockpiled sick masks and hoarded hand sanitizer from retail stores, then turned around and sold them online for absurd prices.
This tactic, called “price-gouging” is highly amoral. Not only do most people not need sick masks for daily activities, but the people hoarding them are taking valuable stock away from the healthcare workers who actually need them. 
And when it comes to hand sanitizer, there isn’t much point in paying out the nose for it. Scientists have determined that plain old soap is highly effective at melting the fatty outer coating of the virus. Hand sanitizer is still valuable, but it’s a better idea to make sure health care professionals have access.
In short, don’t pay extra for stuff you don’t need; otherwise, you’ll only have yourself to blame when you need that extra money to cover your sick days.
Speaking of which — if you feel sick, don’t come to work! Self-isolation is one of our greatest tools in combating this threat. By staying hygienic and informed, we have a much better shot of keeping this virus contained. Plus, you won’t be exposing others to illness.
