# Unlock the Hidden Gems of Your Huawei and Honor Phones with this Ultimate Launcher Hack!

If you are using a Huawei or Honor phone, you probably know that the EMUI launcher comes pre-installed with the device. While the default launcher is perfect for most people, some users might want to experiment with different launchers to get a better customization experience.

If you are one of those users looking to dive into the world of launchers, then you are in luck. In this article, we are going to show you how to unlock the hidden gems of your Huawei and Honor phones with this ultimate launcher hack.

## Step 1: Download and Install Nova Launcher

Nova Launcher is one of the most popular third-party launchers available on the Play Store, and it's the one we recommend for Huawei and Honor phones. To download and install Nova Launcher, follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Play Store on your Huawei or Honor phone.
2. Search for "Nova Launcher" and select it from the results.
3. Tap the "Install" button to begin the installation process.

## Step 2: Set Nova Launcher as Your Default Launcher

Once Nova Launcher is installed, you need to set it as your default launcher to use it instead of the EMUI launcher. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Go to "Settings" on your Huawei or Honor phone.
2. Tap on "Apps & notifications" and then "Default apps."
3. Select "Home app" and choose "Nova Launcher" from the list of available launchers.

## Step 3: Customize Your Nova Launcher Settings

Now that you have set Nova Launcher as your default launcher, it's time to customize your settings. Nova Launcher offers a wide range of customization options, including:

- Changing the app drawer style and layout
- Customizing the icons for individual apps
- Changing the grid size and icon size
- Customizing the home screen layout and app shortcuts

To customize your settings, follow these steps:

1. Long-press on the home screen to bring up the Nova Launcher settings menu.
2. Select "Nova Settings" and then choose "Desktop" or "App & widget drawers" to customize your settings.

## Step 4: Install Nova Launcher Prime for Added Features

Nova Launcher Prime is a paid version of the app that offers even more customization options and features. Some of the added features include:

- Gestures for opening apps and shortcuts
- Unread count badges for app icons

Huawei has been making some impressive smartphones like the P20 Pro and the Mate 20 Pro. However, the company’s EMUI leaves a lot to be desired and for some reason, Huawei has a knack for not being too kind towards third-party launchers. While on other Android devices, switching to a third-party launcher is a relatively easy process, it is not so simple on Huawei and its sub-brand Honor phones.

This does not mean that one cannot switch to a third-party launcher in EMUI. It is just that the process is more complicated than it should be. If you are confused as to how you replace the default EMUI launcher on your Huawei or Honor phone, follow the steps mentioned below.

 
### How to Change Default Launcher in EMUI 9 on Huawei Mate 20, P20, Nova 3


Step 1: Download and install a third-party launcher of your choice. My recommendation would be to try out Nova Launcher or Action launcher if you have not tried a custom launcher before.

Step 2: Once installed, you will have to set it as the default launcher. For this, head over to Settings -> Apps -> Default Apps -> Launcher. Select Nova launcher from this list.

The above steps will only work on non-Chinese variants of Huawei phones like the Mate 20 Pro, P20 series, Nova series, and more. The Chinese version of Emotion UI makes it even more difficult to switch to a third-party launcher for safety and security reasons.
Do note that using a third-party launcher will create some issues with navigation gestures on your Huawei phone. There’s not much you can do about but I guess using a third-party launcher with navigation bar is better than using the stock Emotion UI launcher which offers a very poor user experience.
Apart from Huawei phones, the steps will also work on Honor phones like the Honor 10, Honor View 20, Honor 10 Lite, and more. If you are still facing issues while changing the default launcher on your Huawei or Honor phone, drop a comment and we will help you out.
