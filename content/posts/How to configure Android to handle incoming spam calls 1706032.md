# Stop Annoying Spam Calls Once and For All! Learn How to Configure Your Android Today!

If you're like most people, you're probably tired of constantly receiving spam calls on your Android phone. With an estimated 26 billion robocalls made to Americans in 2019 alone, unwanted calls have become a major problem that's showing no signs of slowing down. Fortunately, with a few simple tweaks to your Android phone's settings, you can significantly reduce the number of spam calls you receive each day. In this article, we'll show you how.

## Enable "Call Screening" on Your Phone

To start, make sure your device is running Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) or later. Then, go to your phone's Dialer app and tap on the three-dot menu in the upper-right corner. From there, select "Settings" and then scroll down to the "Spam and Call Screen" option. Here, you'll see an option to enable "Call Screening."

When this feature is on, incoming calls from unknown numbers will be automatically screened by Google Assistant. The Assistant will answer the call and ask the caller to state their name and reason for calling. You'll then receive a transcript of the caller's response and can choose whether or not to answer the call. This can be a great way to screen out unwanted calls without having to pick up the phone.

## Use the "Block Calls" Feature

If you're receiving spam calls from the same number over and over again, you can block the number to prevent further calls. To do this, open the Phone app and select the number you want to block. Tap on the three-dot menu in the upper-right corner and select "Block/report spam." From there, you'll have the option to block the number or report it as spam.

## Install a Third-Party App

There are several third-party call blocking apps available on the Google Play Store that can help you filter out unwanted calls. One popular app is Mr. Number, which allows you to block calls and texts from specific numbers or entire area codes. You can also create custom block lists and receive spam call alerts.

Another useful app is Call Blocker, which not only blocks unwanted calls but also provides a log of all blocked calls and texts. This can be helpful if you're trying to keep track of how many spam calls you're receiving.

## Conclusion

With these simple tips, you can significantly reduce the number of spam calls you receive on your Android phone. Whether you choose to enable call screening, block specific numbers, or install a third-party app, taking action to block spam calls can help you reclaim your peace of mind and avoid unnecessary interruptions throughout the day. So what are you waiting for? Start blocking those spam calls today!

Thankfully, Android has some pretty handy tools built right into the phone app to help you banish those spam calls. These built-in configuration options work in conjunction with Google's spam database (which is frequently updated) to keep those calls from inundating your phone.

However, you can't just expect Google to take care of everything. You need to make a couple of configuration changes within the phone app to get the most out of the service. That's what I'm going to help you with. Once you've taken care of this, your spam calls should be considerably reduced.
Will it put a complete end to them? No. But the more you use it, the fewer spam calls you'll receive.

When a suspected spam call comes in, it will automatically be screened for you with these two options enabled, so you won't have to do anything about them. As a bonus, on the Call Screen options page, if you choose, you can also select First-time callers and choose the same automatic screening option that you did for spam and robocalls. 
Since I've enabled these settings (which I did probably two years ago), I've seen spam calls reduced to almost zero. I highly recommend that you do the same, so you can enjoy far fewer unnecessary interruptions throughout your busy day.
