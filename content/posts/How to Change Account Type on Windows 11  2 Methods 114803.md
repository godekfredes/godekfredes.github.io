The same goes for the latest operating system from Microsoft – Windows 11. What’s more useful is that Windows 11 allows you to change the account type after it’s been created. This means you can easily change the account type of your family members and make them an administrator.
While providing administrator access to guest accounts is not recommended, you can change the account type to Administrator if you are the PC owner and using a standard account. Doing so will provide you with complete control of the device and apps.
Additionally, changing the account type to Administrator will eliminate the need for manually running apps in Administrator mode, ‘Run as administrator’. Similarly, if you want to provide a specific user account in a more secure environment, you can switch the account type to Standard user.
