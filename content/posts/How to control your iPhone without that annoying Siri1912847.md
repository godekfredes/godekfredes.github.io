Unlock the Hidden Secrets to Mastering Your iPhone Without Siri's Irritating Voice!

If you are an iPhone user, you are likely already familiar with Siri, the virtual assistant that helps you navigate your device. However, while Siri can be useful, her voice can quickly become annoying. Luckily, there are plenty of other ways to master your iPhone without relying on Siri's irritating tone. Here are some tips and tricks to help you take control of your iPhone and become a true master of your device.

1. Use Control Center

One of the most powerful tools available to iPhone users is Control Center. With just a swipe up from the bottom of the screen, you can quickly access a range of important features, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Airplane Mode. You can also adjust the brightness of your screen, play music, and even launch the camera. This is an excellent way to take control of your phone without the need to rely on Siri's voice.

2. Learn Keyboard Shortcuts

If you are tired of using Siri to open apps, try using keyboard shortcuts instead. These are quick actions that you can perform by pressing a combination of keys on your keyboard. For example, if you need to quickly open an app, you can press the home button twice to bring up the app switcher. Alternatively, you can use the touch and hold feature on your iPhone to bring up a menu of shortcuts for commonly used tasks.

3. Customize Your Settings

One of the best things about iPhones is that they are highly customizable. By taking the time to explore your phone's settings, you can make it work exactly the way you want it to. For example, you can customize your notifications and alerts, change the wallpaper on your lock screen, or even customize the way your phone vibrates. By making these tweaks, you can create a phone that is tailored to your needs and preferences.

4. Try Voice Memos

While Siri can be annoying, there are still some ways to use your voice to take control of your iPhone. One of the best ways to do this is by using the Voice Memos app. With this app, you can quickly and easily record audio notes or memos, hands-free. This is a great way to take a quick note without having to type it out manually.

In conclusion, there are plenty of ways to master your iPhone without Siri's annoying voice. By using control center, learning keyboard shortcuts, customizing your settings, and trying voice memos, you can take total control of your device and enjoy a more efficient and enjoyable user experience. So, next time Siri's tone becomes too much, remember that there are always other ways to take control of your iPhone.

But when you want to use your iPhone with only your voice, Siri is your best friend. Or rather, she had to be until iOS 13. In the latest update, you can set up Voice Control and navigate your phone — without Siri.
Even if you love Siri, Voice Control gives you so many more options, you’d really miss out if you don’t set it up. So read on to learn what Voice Control can let you do, how to set it up on your iPhone, and how to customize it.

 
## What Voice Control can do


Voice Control gives you the ability to move through your phone by speaking. You can say, “swipe left” or “scroll up” to move where you want on your screen, or within an app. You can also open apps and take pictures with your front or rear camera with a simple command. 
With Voice Control, you can dictate text messages or notes to yourself, delete text you’ve typed and tap on buttons or links without physically touching your phone. You can even repeat commands by saying, “Repeat (whatever number you want) times,” and disable or enable Voice Control by saying, “Go to sleep” or “Wake up.” 
These features are handy if you want to scroll through a recipe while your hands are busy, or if you have a disability. So in addition to coming with great new security features, which you can learn about here, iOS 13 is making the iPhone more accessible.  

 
## Set it up


Interested in getting Voice Control working on your phone? Just follow the steps below, and you’ll be using it in no time. 

 
Update your iPhone’s OS to iOS 13. You can do this by going to Settings, tapping General, then tapping Software Update. Tap “Download and Install” for iOS 13.Once you have iOS 13, go back to your Settings. Tap “Accessibility.”Tap “Voice Control.”Tap “Set Up Voice Control.” You will need to be on Wi-Fi to download the program.Tap the blue “Continue” button at the bottom of the screen and “Continue” again in the next window.You will be asked if you want to share your activity or voice with Apple as you use Voice Control. Tap “Allow” or “Don’t Allow,” depending on your preference.A blue microphone icon will appear in the status bar at the top of your screen, indicating Voice Control is working.


To see the list of commands you can make, say “What can I say?” and take a look at the list. 
You can turn Voice Control on or off verbally, but you can also do so in your settings. Just go to Settings > Accessibility > Voice Control, and toggle the switch. You can also say “Disable Voice Control” to turn the feature off.

## How to customize Voice Control


Making it an even better accessibility feature, and one that’s fun to play around with, you can add custom commands to Voice Control. Say one phrase for several actions, or to quickly add or delete text. Follow the steps below to add a custom command: 

 
Go to Settings, then Accessibility, and tap Voice Control.Tap “Customize Commands” and “Create New Command…”Type in the phrase you’ll say to make the action happen. For a quick email insertion, type “Insert my email address” or a similar phrase.Tap “Action.” You’ll now have four options of what the action can be: “Insert Text,” “Run Custom Gesture,” “Run Shortcut” and “Playback Recorded Commands.” We’ll break these down in a moment.For the sake of the example, choose “Insert Text” and type your email address into the box. Once your action is set up,  tap “New Command,” then “Application.” Here you’ll decide if you want your command available in one particular app, or in all apps on your iPhone. Tap “Back,” then “Save” in the top right corner to finish making your custom command. 


To see or edit custom commands, simply go to Settings > Accessibility > Voice Control > Customize Commands > Custom. Just tap the one you want to delete or edit, then tap the “Edit” button on the top right of the screen.
Now, back to the four options you can choose from when customizing and creating new commands:

 
With “Insert Text,” you’ll type in what you want to have typed out for you when you say your custom phrase.“Run Custom Gesture” means you can record gestures habitually performed in apps. This is useful for games or apps that require unique motions. A great example is the “touch-and-hold” gesture, which allows your phone to hold down a spot on your phone for you, such as a button when you issue your custom command.With “Run Shortcut,” you get a list of Siri shortcuts that can be activated by Voice Control, in case you want her involved in the action, like with texting a particular contact.With “Playback Recorded Commands,” you can record a series of commands, like opening one app, copying text and pasting it in another, so that all happens with one phrase.


You can add vocabulary to Voice Control as well, to allow it to type things that are a little tricky to spell. Add and later delete vocabulary by doing the following:

 
Go to Settings > Accessibility > Voice Control.Tap “Vocabulary.”Tap the blue plus sign (“+”) in the upper right corner, and type in the word or phrase you want Voice Control to know.Tap “Save.”
