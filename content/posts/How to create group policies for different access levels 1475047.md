Unlock Secret Levels of Security: Master the Art of Group Policies for Ultimate Access Control!

In this digital age, security should be one of the top priorities of businesses and organizations. With the ever-evolving technological advancements, we face constant risks from cyber attacks and threats that can lead to breaches, data theft, and data loss. It is essential that we take all the necessary measures to secure our data, systems, and networks.

Group Policies are an essential feature of Windows Server that can improve the security of your computers and network. Group Policies allow administrators to manage multiple users and computers in one go, ensuring that they adhere to certain restrictions and constraints. Administrators can control settings such as password policies, software installation, user access, and many more. By mastering the art of Group Policies, you can unlock secret levels of security that will provide ultimate access control to your network.

Here are some tricks and tips to help you master the art of Group Policies:

1. Analyze and Plan

The first step is to analyze and plan what policies you need to implement. Determine how to control and manage the access of the users to the network and computers. Some policies to consider include user account policies, password policies, network security policies, and software installation policies. Analyze your needs and set them up accordingly.

2. Group Policy Management Console

The Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) is the primary tool for managing Group Policies. It allows administrators to create, modify, and manage Group Policies effectively. In addition, it offers various options to monitor, report, and troubleshoot issues related to Group Policies.

3. Implement Best Practices

It is crucial to implement best practices when it comes to the Group Policies. It is recommended to segregate policies based on user roles and departments. By doing so, you can provide specific access rights to users as per their roles and enhance the security of the network.

4. Review Group Policy Settings Regularly

It is essential to review Group Policy settings regularly to ensure that they are still relevant and effective. As businesses and organizations change over time, so do the policies. Regular review of policies can help to identify any discrepancies and resolve them promptly.

In conclusion, the ultimate aim of Group Policies is to provide enhanced access control to the network and computers. By mastering the art of Group Policies, businesses and organizations can ensure that their systems are secure, and data integrity is maintained. It is crucial to analyze, plan, and implement the best practices to reap the benefits of Group Policies fully. So, it's time to unlock the secret levels of security by mastering the art of Group Policies!

Windows 10 security offers improved features from previous versions and some new features. These features include; Microsoft BitLocker, New Windows Defender features, Windows Defender SmartScreen, Window Defender Application Guard, Windows Defender Device Guard, Windows Defender Credential Guard, Windows 10 feature release version 1903 changes, Windows Sandbox, Windows Update, and Better Security Baselines.

 
## Access Levels


Microsoft BitLocker isn’t new but it provides encryption for the full drive. It’s available on Windows Enterprise and Pro editions. Though this isn’t new, it does offer a new intrusion prevention class capabilities. Windows defender is the anti-virus and anti-malware software included on all Microsoft Windows products. Windows defender smartscreen adds more phishing and malware protection. It blocks sites right away that are known to be hazardous. Windows defender application guard protects the Microsoft Edge web browser from threats and attacks. It also has a whitelist of trusted sites, making sure those are accessed with greater ease. It opens non-trusted sites within a container that is isolated, much like a sandbox is used for executables. Windows defender device guard is made to frustrate cyber attackers by moving from a mode where applications on a whitelist are used, to a mode where only enterprise- trust application and drivers can be used. In addition, the device guard adds protection for legacy applications, so they may be used. Windows defender credential guard uses virtualization to provide security. It isolates credentials so only approved software can use them. Windows sandbox is available for Windows 10 Enterprise and Pro. It provides separate test space to run executables without threat of harm to the system. Windows 10 increased the security baseline. It enabled svchost.exe with the 1903 update. 

 
## Group Policy and Data Security


Data security in Windows 10 includes Microsoft Azure Information Protection. Azure protects information by making the classifications smaller and more granular, by sharing information that is sensitive, and granting permissions for advanced needs. Local user account authentication, which would include picture passwords and traditional logins is replaced with Windows Hello. Windows Hello has a two-factor verification to start. From there the user can choose a gesture. Gestures include facial recognition, fingerprint, and biometric, in addition to a pin. Cloud based authentication is also available. Hardening is an important step in securing a Windows 10 host. It limits the vulnerabilities an attacker could exploit. It also helps to direct the user to set up the computer the way they would like, instead of staying in default. The first thing to do is install Windows 10 fresh, from the usb drive. Then all extra programs are deleted. BitLocker then encrypts the drive. Updates are then run. Following that setting group policies is a logical step. It’s especially important for large organizations. 

 
## Local Group Policy


Local Group Policy keeps users isolated in their own space so they can’t affect the network. To begin this process, the Group Policy Management Editor needs to be accessed. From there the control panel access can be limited. LAN manager passwords can then be prevented from being stored in hashes. Access to the command prompt is then limited. In addition forced system restarts are blocked. Removable drives are banned followed by disabling the guest account. Installing software is limited. Then passwords are required to be longer and fresher. Then they disable the anonymous SID enumeration. At that point a secure network Group Policies Object (GPO) can be set for everyone. 

 
## Conclusion


A few additional Windows 10 security measures can be applied and instituted for wireless networks. Some organizations could import the 802.1x standard. This requires access control rather than other credentials. The DirectAccess feature could be used more for greater security. The greatest option is the Virtual Private Network (VPN) when a wireless network is untrusted.
