Truecaller is a popular Caller ID and spam blocking app that helps you identify unknown callers and block unwanted calls and texts. The app has a massive database of phone numbers and contact information from all over the world. When someone calls you and their number is not saved in your phone's contact list, Truecaller searches its database to identify the caller and displays their name and profile picture on your screen.

However, sometimes Truecaller can get your name wrong, or display information that you do not want to share with others. In such cases, changing your name in Truecaller can help protect your privacy, and here's how to do it:
