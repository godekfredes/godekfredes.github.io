# WARNING: Are you making these TOP 3 small business mistakes? Here's how to avoid them and skyrocket your success!

Small business owners often face tremendous challenges that may put their businesses in peril. The success of any small business depends largely on the entrepreneur's ability to steer clear of common mistakes. In this article, we'll cover the top three small business mistakes and provide tips on how to avoid them to help you skyrocket your success.

# Mistake #1: Not Investing in Marketing

Marketing is an essential aspect of any business's success. Without proper marketing, your business will struggle to get new customers, retain existing ones, and build a loyal following. Unfortunately, many small business owners overlook the importance of marketing or fail to invest enough resources in it. This can be a costly mistake that holds back growth and revenue potential.

To avoid this mistake, invest in marketing efforts that align with your business goals. Digital marketing is an affordable way to reach a broad audience, build brand awareness, and generate leads. Consider starting with social media marketing, email marketing, or SEO. You can also explore more traditional marketing methods such as print or radio advertising, direct mail, or sponsorships.

# Mistake #2: Neglecting Financials

Small business owners often wear many hats, and that can lead to neglecting crucial financial tasks. Financials are critical to the success of your business, and neglecting them can create significant issues that could put your business in jeopardy. Failure to keep accurate financial records and maintain a cash reserve can make it challenging for businesses to navigate slow periods or unexpected expenses.

To avoid this mistake, take the time to learn about basic accounting principles, manage your cash flow effectively, and prepare accurate financial statements. Hire an accountant or bookkeeper if necessary, and avoid mixing personal and business finances. Finally, make it a priority to set aside money for taxes and other expenses.

# Mistake #3: Failing to Plan

Another common mistake small business owners make is failing to plan. Without a clear plan, businesses often struggle to grow, make progress, or meet their objectives. Planning is essential for identifying goals, developing strategies, and tracking progress. It also helps ensure that everyone in the business is working in alignment toward a common goal.

To avoid this mistake, take the time to develop a detailed business plan that outlines your goals, strategies, and projections. Be realistic in your planning and set measurable objectives that are achievable over time. Review your plan regularly, and adapt it as needed to reflect changes in the market or your business.

In conclusion, small business owners face many challenges that can be overcome with the right approach. To avoid common mistakes that can slow progress and harm your bottom line, make sure to invest in marketing, manage your finances diligently, and develop a detailed business plan. With these measures in place, your small business can thrive and achieve the success you envision.

Putting out fires and overcoming hurdles have been in your job description for as long as you can remember, but you may not realize how many issues you can avoid with just a few changes. 
In the bustle of day-to-day operations, you have a lot on your plate. It’s easy to overlook issues, big and small, that could be holding you back. That’s why our sponsor, Dell Small Business, is here to help. Read on for the top 3 mistakes small business owners are making and the pro tips on how to avoid them.

 
## 1. Saying “yes”


In most small businesses, the owner is a jack-of-all-trades and does everything to keep operations running smoothly. From accounting to marketing to cleaning, a small business owner is the one who gets the job done — no matter what.
But that doesn’t mean you have to spread yourself so thin you neglect to work “on” your business and just continue to work “in” your business doing mundane tasks. It’s important to dedicate time to strategize and plan for the future. Without that, it’s hard to see the bigger picture. 
Do you need to pivot your business strategies or change direction? Give yourself time to find out. But how do you make time when you’re already doing so much each day? It’s simple: Make it a priority to not say “yes” to everything. 
It’s OK to delegate admin tasks or other daily chores to someone else. With the proper training, anyone can perform tasks just as well, or even better than you can.
By being more selective about what you say “yes” to, you can make time to focus on important business matters that often get overlooked when you’re knee-deep in data entry logs or other tasks someone else can take on.

 
## 2. Missing out


Are you following up on your list of leads and inquiries? Just because a prospect was a “no” yesterday doesn’t mean they’re a “no” today. Oftentimes, “no” really translates to “not at this time.”
Take a few minutes to pick up the phone and call your leads, or send out a follow-up email. Take control of your prospects and you may just land a few more orders or new clients. 
That outreach also keeps you at the top of their minds. Even those not ready to move forward may know someone else who needs your product or service, and those referrals are valuable.
Unanswered inquiries, voicemails and email questions from your social media channels could mean lost revenue for your business. Don’t leave money on the table. Follow up with every new lead who contacts you, and find out how you can make them a customer.

 
## 3. Not listening


Your customers are always giving you subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) clues about how they feel about your product or service. This is invaluable information, and you should consider using it when planning future updates, customer communications and marketing efforts.
How do you keep up with what customers are saying? Read reviews, social media comments and mentions, and any emails or other communications from clients and users.
And don’t leave those reviews unanswered! Thank your customers for positive reviews, and take the time to respond to negative feedback. This info may even help you improve and relaunch your product or service to benefit your customers even more.
How does this work in practice? If you sell electronics and a customer expresses concern over the functionality of a product, listen closely. See what others are saying or if you can replicate the same issues yourself. You may have changes to make. 
If you run a custard shop and a patron is upset you aren’t offering more flavors, brainstorm additions to the menu. Don’t ignore reviews. Use them as a tool to improve your business and draw in more customers.
By being proactive, you can prevent some of the most common small business mistakes. Scale your business to its full potential by focusing on strategy, growth and your customers. Find out how Dell Small Business can help you grow your company to new heights.
