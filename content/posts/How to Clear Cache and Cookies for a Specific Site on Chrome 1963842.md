Title: You Won't Believe How Clearing Cache and Cookies for a Specific Site on Chrome Will Change Your Browsing Experience!

Introduction:
Are you tired of experiencing lags and slow browsing speeds while accessing your favorite website on Google Chrome? Are you encountering issues with logging in or loading content? Then it's high time you clear the cache and cookies for that specific website you're experiencing issues with.

Google Chrome, like most web browsers, stores information about websites that you visit. This information includes photos, videos, passwords, and other data that help improve your browsing experience. However, over time, these cached files and cookies can become outdated and take up valuable storage space.

In this article, we'll delve into how clearing cache and cookies for a specific site on Chrome will change your browsing experience.

Step One: Identify the Culprit
The first step towards clearing cache and cookies for a specific site on Chrome is identifying the website causing the issue. Once you identify the site, you can clear the cached files and cookies for that site only.

Step Two: Clear Cache on Chrome

1. Open the Chrome browser 
2. Click on the three vertical dots icon in the top right corner of the browser window. 
3. Select More Tools. 
4. Click on Clear browsing data from the drop-down menu. 
5. In the Clear browsing data window, select the Time range for which you want to delete data in the Time Range drop-down menu.

In Summary


Clearing Chrome’s cache and cookies is one way to fix website formatting or loading issues on your computer.
However, this approach ends up deleting the data for all websites you’ve visited on Chrome in the past. And thus, requires you to log in to every website again, and in some cases, causes you to experience slowed page loading speeds.
A better approach instead is to clear cache and cookies for that particular site that’s exhibiting formatting or loading issues.







While going this route to fix internet problems is fine, and you may want to do it over time to prevent temporary files from slowing down your browser, it isn’t an ideal solution when you know the problem is specific to a particular website.
A better approach in this situation is to clear cache and cookies for that particular site exhibiting formatting or loading issues. But since not many know how to do it, here’s a guide with instructions to clear cache and cookies for a specific website on Chrome.

 
## Why Would You Want to Clear a Website’s Cache and Cookies?


Generally speaking, there are numerous instances when you’d want to clear a particular website’s cache and cookies. Some of these reasons include:

 

Fixing website loading issues when certain page elements don’t load
Fixing runtime server error
Fixing the 404 Not Found error
Getting the latest version of a website (helpful to developers who need to troubleshoot/update website elements)
Avoiding old/outdated forms
Getting rid of targeted ads temporarily

 
## How to Clear Cache and Cookies for a Specific Site on Chrome Desktop


Clearing cache and cookies for a specific website on Chrome is pretty straightforward. Follow these instructions to do this on your Mac or Windows desktop:

 

Open Chrome.
Tap on the address bar and visit chrome://settings/siteData. Alternatively, you can access the site data page by going into Chrome Settings > Security & privacy, selecting Cookies and other site data, and clicking on See all cookies and site data.

Here, you can scroll the list to find the website whose data you want to clear. Or, you can tap the search box on the top-right and look up that website.
To clear all of the data for that website, hit the delete icon (with the trash can icon) next to the website name. Alternatively, if you’d like to selectively delete the website’s data, tap on its name, and then click the X icon next to the data you want to delete.




Chrome will now delete all website data, including cookies, cache, and other information related to that website. Reload the website, and the page should load successfully.

 
## How to Only Clear Cookies for a Specific Website on Chrome Desktop


As we mentioned, the above method clears all the data about a website—and not just its cookies. However, if you want to just clear cookies for a specific website, maybe if you’re facing login issues, or if you want to (temporarily) clear your tracking records on the site, there’s an alternative way that lets you delete just the website cookies.
Follow these steps to clear cookies for a particular website:

 

Visit the website whose cookies you want to clear.
Tap on the padlock icon that appears before the URL of the website in the address bar and select Cookies.

Click on the website name to list all its cookies.
To delete a single cookie, select it and hit Remove. Alternatively, to delete all of a website’s cookies, select the website name and click on the Remove button.

Hit Done.

 
## How to Clear Cache and Cookies for a Specific Site on Chrome for Android


If you’re on an Android smartphone, you can clear cache and cookies for a specific website in Chrome using the following steps:

 

Open Chrome.
Hit the ellipsis icon on the upper-right corner and select Settings.
Scroll down to the Advanced section and select Site settings.

Tap on All sites on the Site settings page.

Click on the website URL whose data you want to clear. Or alternatively, hit the search icon on the top and look up the domain name.
Hit the Clear & reset button on the next screen and tap Clear & reset to confirm site data deletion.


 
## How to Clear Only Cookies for a Specific Website on Chrome for Android


Similar to how Chrome lets you delete only cookies data for a specific website on desktop, you also have the same option on mobile. However, the only difference is that, unlike its desktop app where you can selectively delete a website’s cookies, you don’t get to do the same on mobile.
Follow these steps to clear a website’s cookies in Chrome on your Android phone:

 

Go to the website whose cookies you wish to delete.
Tap on the downward-pointing arrow in the address bar preceding the website URL and select Cookies.

On the Cookies prompt, click the delete icon and confirm by clicking on Clear to clear all cookies for the website.


 
## Fixing Internet Issues of a Site Without Affecting Others


By clearing the cache and cookies of a specific website, you can easily fix a lot of the internet-related issues of a specific website without affecting the functionality of other websites.
Do note, however, that you won’t have to log back into other websites or experience slowed page loading speeds on them. You’ll just need to log in to the website whose site data (cache, cookies, etc.) you’ve deleted. If this were an eCommerce site, your shopping cart would be cleared. Similarly, if you’ve used the SSO login method on a website, you’ll be logged out and required to sign in again.
