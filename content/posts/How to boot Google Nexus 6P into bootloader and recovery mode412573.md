# Unleash the Full Potential of Your Google Nexus 6P: Learn How to Boot into Bootloader and Recovery Mode with These Simple Steps!

The Google Nexus 6P is undoubtedly one of the most popular Android devices currently available in the market. It comes equipped with some of the most advanced features and specifications, making it a top choice for many tech enthusiasts. However, to truly unleash the full potential of your Nexus 6P, you need to know how to boot into bootloader and recovery mode.

These modes allow you to access important features that are not normally available in regular your device's system. In bootloader mode, you can unlock the device's bootloader, flash custom recovery images, and install custom ROMs, while recovery mode enables you to perform system-level functions like factory resetting, clearing cache and data, and much more.

Here's how you can boot into bootloader and recovery mode on your Nexus 6P.

## Method 1: Using the Power Button and Volume Down Button

1. Turn off your device completely.

2. Press and hold the power button and the volume down button at the same time.

3. Release both buttons once you see the Google logo on your device. You should now see the "Start" option at the top of the screen.

4. Use the volume down button to highlight the "Recovery mode" or "Bootloader" option, and then press the power button to select it.

5. You should now be in either the recovery or bootloader mode.

## Method 2: Using ADB Commands

ADB (Android Debug Bridge) is a command-line tool that allows you to interface with your Android device using your computer. It is a great way to perform advanced system-level tasks on your Nexus 6P.

1. Connect your Nexus 6P to your computer using a USB cable.

2. Enable USB debugging on your device by going to Settings > Developer Options > USB debugging.

3. Open a command prompt window on your computer.

4. Type "adb reboot bootloader" and press enter. This command will reboot your device into bootloader mode.

5. To enter recovery mode, type "adb reboot recovery" and press enter. Your device will now reboot into recovery mode.

In conclusion, booting into bootloader and recovery mode can seem scary for some users. Still, with these simple steps, you can enjoy the full potential of your Nexus 6P and make the most out of its advanced features. Just remember to be careful when making changes to your device, and always back up your data before performing any critical actions.

Every Android device comes with two hidden modes: a Recovery mode and a Bootloader mode. You might have come across the former while installing any kind of OTA update on your device, while the latter is only used when you are running some fastboot commands or using apps like Odin.
The method to boot into bootloader or recovery mode varies from device to device, but generally requires one to press the power and volume keys in a specific combination. The Huawei-made Nexus 6P is no different in this regard. It also comes with a bootloader and a recovery mode that one can enter by pressing the volume and power buttons in a specific combination.
