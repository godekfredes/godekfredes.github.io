Blocking someone on Messenger is a useful feature when you want to put a stop to spam, inappropriate messages, or simply wish to break all ties with someone.

But how do you do all this, and what happens to the messages in the process?

To block someone on Messenger, follow these steps:

Step 3: Tap on their name or profile photo to open their profile.

Step 4: Scroll down and tap on 'Block.'

Step 5: Confirm by selecting 'Block person.'

Once you've blocked someone, they won't be able to send you any new messages or calls, see your profile, or join any group conversations you're in. However, the content of the conversation before you blocked the person is still visible in the chat thread.

If you want to unblock someone on Messenger, follow these steps:

Blocking and unblocking people on Messenger is that simple! It's a great tool to keep unwanted people at bay and manage your online social circle as you deem fit. Keep in mind that the people you block on Messenger are not blocked on Facebook, and vice versa. To block someone on Facebook, you have to go through a different process.
