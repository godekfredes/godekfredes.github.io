Revamp Your BGMI Gameplay with This Easy Trick to Change Hit Damage Effect Color! Become a Pro Player with Just One Click!

BGMI, also known as Battlegrounds Mobile India, is one of the most popular mobile games in the world. It is a battle royale game that attracts millions of players from all over the globe. This game is all about strategy, skills, and survival. To become a pro player, you need to have a lot of dedication and practice. But did you know that there is a secret trick that can help you enhance your gameplay? That's right! By changing the hit damage effect color, you can improve your visual instincts and accuracy. In this article, we will show you how to do it and give some tips to become a pro.

Firstly, let us explain what hit damage effect is. Whenever you hit an opponent in the game, a red damage effect appears on the screen, indicating the amount of damage inflicted. By default, it is set to red, but you can change it according to your preference. Changing it to a different color can improve your reaction time and help you adapt better to the environment. Here is how you can do it in just a few clicks.

Step 1: Open the game and go to the Settings menu.

Step 2: Click on the Graphics tab and scroll down to the "Hit Effect" option.

Step 3: Click on "Choose Hit Effect Color" and select the color you want.

Step 4: Click on "Apply" and enjoy the game with a new hit effect color!

By following these simple steps, you can enhance your gameplay and experience BGMI like never before. But that's only half of the battle. To become a pro player, you must have the right skills and knowledge. Here are some tips to help you get started.

Tip 1: Choose Your Weapons Wisely

One of the most important aspects of the game is choosing the right weapon. Each weapon has its strengths and weaknesses, so you need to know which one to use in different situations. For example, if you are in a close-range combat situation, a shotgun might be the best option, but if you are in a long-range combat situation, a sniper rifle might be better.

Tip 2: Improve Your Aim and Reflexes

BGMI is all about accuracy and precision. To improve your aim, you need to practice on the shooting range and try different techniques. One of the best ways is to use the gyroscope feature on your mobile device, which helps you aim more accurately. It might take some time to get used to it, but once you do, you will notice a significant improvement in your gameplay.

Tip 3: Enhance Your Map Reading Skills

To survive in the game, you need to have a good understanding of the map and terrain. You should know where the high-risk areas are, where the loot is, and where the best hiding spots are. By developing your map reading skills, you can increase your chances of survival and make better decisions in the game.

In conclusion, Battlegrounds Mobile India is a game that requires skill, strategy, and dedication. By changing the hit damage effect color, you can enhance your gameplay and become a pro player with just one click. But don't forget to develop your skills and knowledge of the game by choosing your weapons wisely, improving your aim and reflexes, and enhancing your map reading skills. With these tips, you can become the master of the battleground and win the game.

Recently, BGMI also got a big update introducing a new mode and a few other gaming items. Although BGMI shares most of the features and game settings from the PUBG Mobile Global edition, Krafton has tweaked a few gaming features.
You will notice while playing BGMI is the new hit color. Now, on being shot, instead of red blood, players get to see green blood with infused green leaves. Actually, on PUBG Mobile, the hit or kill effect used to be red, but BGMI uses Green by default whenever you take a hit or hit other players.
Many users didn’t like the new hit color. So, if you are also one of them, you can change the color of the blood by following some easy steps.
