# You won't believe how easy it is to transform your Samsung Galaxy Note 7 with these wallpaper tips!

Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 has been known for its vibrant and high-resolution display. And the best way to showcase its display capabilities is by using attractive wallpapers that not only enhance the look of the device but also give it an alluring edge. While the store-bought wallpapers may suffice for some users, there is no harm in experimenting with custom wallpapers to make your device stand out.

Here are some top tips to transform your Samsung Galaxy Note 7 with exciting wallpapers.

## 1. Go for high-quality

When choosing a wallpaper, don't settle for low-quality pictures. They tend to blur and pixelate, making them appear unpleasant. Instead, opt for high-quality wallpapers that are clear and vibrant. You can download high-quality wallpapers from various online sources or create your own.

## 2. Go minimalistic

Less is more, and that applies to wallpapers too. Instead of cluttering your device with multiple images or busy wallpapers, opt for minimalistic designs. This can range from aesthetically pleasing patterns to simple yet eye-catching designs.

## 3. Go personalized

One way you can make your Samsung Galaxy Note 7 feel more personalized is by using a custom wallpaper. You can create a wallpaper using your favorite picture or a photo that holds sentimental value. This way, you can make your device feel like an extension of yourself.

## 4. Go evergreen

Using trendy wallpapers can make your device feel outdated within a short period. However, using classic and iconic wallpapers provides a timeless feel. Some classic examples include landscape wallpapers or black and white patterns.

## 5. Go for contrast

Enhance the device's display by choosing wallpapers with high contrast. This not only makes the wallpaper look more defined but also enhances the text readability. A wallpaper with a dark background and light-colored image or vice versa works beautifully.

## 6. Go with the seasons

Another way to transform your Samsung Galaxy Note 7 using wallpapers is by changing them according to the seasons. Use wallpapers that have a winter or summer theme, depending on the season. This can make the device feel festive and relevant.

Conclusion:

Using wallpapers is an effortless way to enhance the overall look and feel of your Samsung Galaxy Note 7. With these tips, you can create a customized and dynamic wallpaper collection that suits your style and personality. Remember that changing wallpapers regularly can renew the device's look and keep it feeling fresh without spending money on new accessories or cases.

One of the first things you might want to do on your new Galaxy Note 7 is to change the wallpaper from the default one provided.
