Introduction:
Are you tired of seeing washed-out colors on your PC display? Do you want to improve the quality of the video output from your computer to your monitor? If yes, then this article is for you!

In this article, we will reveal the secrets to unlocking crystal clear display quality using simple HDMI tricks on your PC. These tricks will make your videos look more vivid and realistic, providing you with the ultimate viewing experience!

Body:
HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) is a popular digital interface that connects devices such as computers, laptops, gaming consoles, and media players to a display such as a TV or monitor. HDMI transmits high-quality video and audio signals, making it the preferred choice for many content creators and enthusiasts.

To get the best output quality from your PC using HDMI, there are several things you can do. Consider these tricks:

1. Update Your Graphics Driver:
Outdated graphics drivers can cause display issues and poor video output quality. Ensure that your graphics card driver is up-to-date to eliminate the chances of having washed-out colors.

2. Adjust Your Display Settings:
The display settings on your PC can cause washed-out colors if not correctly configured. Go to your display settings and adjust the gamma, brightness, and saturation settings to achieve richer color output. Experiment with the settings until you find a balance that works well for you.

3. Use the Right HDMI Cable:
Not all HDMI cables are created equal. A low-quality HDMI cable can cause signal loss, leading to poor video output quality. Invest in a high-quality HDMI cable that can transmit high-resolution signals without signal loss.

4. Disable Overscan:
Overscan is a feature that crops a portion of your display output, leading to a distorted image. Disable overscan to ensure that you get the whole image as intended.

5. Use a High-Resolution Display:
Using a high-resolution display can make a big difference in the output quality of your videos. A high-resolution monitor can display more pixels, resulting in a clearer, sharper, and more vivid image.

Conclusion:
There you have it – the secrets to unlocking crystal clear display quality using simple HDMI tricks on your PC. Try these tricks today and see the difference for yourself. With HDMI, you can enjoy the ultimate viewing experience without compromising on quality.

If this happened, the issue is not your display but your graphics card that isn’t converting or processing the colors quite well.
If you are willing to calibrate your computer display and fix it from rendering the washed-out colors, just read this article, as you will find the easy fix there.

 
## Steps to Avoid Washed-Out Colors When Using HDMI on Your PC


The TV screens or the PCs show the “RGB Full” colors where the value for the colors is set to 0-255. The 0 represents the lowest value for the blackest black, while the 255 represents the whitest white color production for the screen.
If you are facing the issue where the screen of your computer connected via HDMI shows washed-out colors, then the possible reason might be that the graphics card of your PC is processing 16-235 colors, i.e., RGB Limited colors where the value for the blackest black is the 16 and for the whitest white color is the 235.
This could be compared to the 0-255 color production, and the levels are washed out for your screen. To correct your display colors, you need to set it up to 0-255 colors; let’s take a look at how this could be established for various graphic cards:

 
### Set up RGB Full on NVIDIA Graphics Card


First of all, right-click on the desktop background on your PC and then from the list menu that appears, look forward to the option named “NVIDIA Control Panel” and just click on it.

You will see that the NVIDIA Control Panel window will launch. From there, select Display and then, Change Resolution options.
On the next screen, click on the “Output Dynamic Range Box” and select “Full.” That’s all; the graphics would then process up RGB Full colors for your display!

 
### Set up RGB Full on AMD Graphics Card


First of all, right-click on the desktop background on your PC, and then from the list menu that appears, look forward to the option named “AMD Radeon Settings” and just click on it.

Next, select Display, and then Preferences > Pixel Format. On the next screen, click on the “Color Pixel Format” box and select “RGB 4:4:4 Pixel Format PC Standard (Full RGB)“. That’s all; the graphics would then process up RGB Full colors for your display!

 
### Set up RGB Full on Intel Graphics Card


First of all, right-click on the desktop background on your PC, and then from the list menu that appears, look forward to the option named “Graphics Properties” and just click on it.
You will see that the NVIDIA Intel Graphics Panel window will launch. From there, select Display > General Settings > Advanced.

On the next screen, click on the “Full Range” option under the Quantization Range. That’s all; the graphics would then process up RGB Full colors for your display.
So you have now got the method by which the screen connected to the PC via HDMI producing washed-out colors could be fixed. If you need more help related to this, let us know in the comments below.
