Protect Your iPhone: The Foolproof Method To Safely Upgrade To iOS 14 With Secure Backups!

iOS 14, Apple's latest operating system for iPhones, was released in September 2020. It offers new features such as widgets, app library, and picture-in-picture mode, among other things. However, upgrading to iOS 14 can be a daunting task for many iPhone users, especially those who have not updated their device in a long time. Protecting your iPhone should be your utmost priority, and a secure backup is the key to a safe and hassle-free upgrade. This article guides you through the foolproof method of backing up your iPhone before upgrading to iOS 14.

Why do you need to backup your iPhone?

Backing up your iPhone is crucial before any software update. There is always a risk of data loss during the upgrade process, and therefore, it is essential to have a backup of all your data. In case something goes wrong during the upgrade, having a backup will give you a fallback option to restore your iPhone to its previous state.

There are two methods of backing up your iPhone: iCloud backup and iTunes backup. Let's discuss how to use both methods to backup your iPhone securely.

iCloud Backup

iCloud is Apple's cloud storage service that offers a convenient and secure way to backup your iPhone. Before creating an iCloud backup, ensure that your iPhone is connected to a Wi-Fi network and has enough storage space for the backup.

Here are the steps to create an iCloud backup:

1. On your iPhone, go to Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud > iCloud Backup.

2. Toggle on the iCloud Backup option.

3. Tap on the 'Back Up Now' option to initiate the backup process.

The time taken to complete the backup will depend on the size of your iPhone's data and the speed of your Wi-Fi connection. Once the iCloud backup is complete, you can proceed to upgrade your device.

iTunes Backup

iTunes is a desktop application that allows you to manage your iPhone's content and perform backups. Before creating an iTunes backup, ensure that you have the latest version of iTunes installed on your computer.

Here are the steps to create an iTunes backup:

1. Connect your iPhone to your computer using a Lightning cable.

2. Open iTunes on your desktop, and your device should appear in the top-left corner of the window.

3. Click on the iPhone icon and select 'Summary.'

4. In the 'Backups' section, click on the 'Back Up Now' button to initiate the backup process.

5. Once the backup is complete, verify that it was successful by checking the 'Latest Backup' section.

Conclusion

Upgrading to iOS 14 is an exciting experience that can enhance your iPhone's performance and functionality. However, it is vital to backup your device before performing the upgrade to avoid any data loss. The iCloud and iTunes backup methods discussed in this article are secure and convenient ways to create a backup of your iPhone. By following these steps, you can upgrade to iOS 14 with confidence, knowing that your data is safe and secure.
