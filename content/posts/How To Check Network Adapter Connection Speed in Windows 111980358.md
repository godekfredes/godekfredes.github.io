Are you tired of slow internet and buffering while streaming your favorite shows? Or maybe you are struggling to connect to your network at all? The issue could lie with your network adapter connection speed. Fortunately, Windows 11 has a built-in feature that allows you to check this easily.

In this article, we will discuss how you can check your network adapter connection speed in Windows 11 with a few easy steps.

## What is a Network Adapter?

Before we dive into the steps, let’s quickly discuss what a network adapter is. A network adapter is a hardware component that allows your computer to connect to a network. It is also commonly known as a network interface controller (NIC).

There are two types of network adapters: wireless and wired. Wireless network adapters connect to a network through Wi-Fi, while wired network adapters connect through Ethernet cables.

## Steps to Check Your Network Adapter Connection Speed in Windows 11

Now that you know what a network adapter is let’s discuss how you can check its connection speed in Windows 11.

Step 1: Open Network Settings

The first step is to open the Windows 11 Network Settings. You can do this by clicking on the Wi-Fi symbol in the taskbar and selecting “Network Settings”.

Step 2: Select the Network

Next, select the network that you are connected to. You can do this by clicking on “Properties” under the network name.

Step 3: Check Connection Properties

Once you are on the Properties page, scroll down to “Network Properties” and look for the “Link Speed (Receive/Transmit)” section. Here, you will see the connection speed of your network adapter.

If you have a wireless network adapter, the speed will be listed in Mbps (megabits per second). If you have a wired network adapter, the speed will be listed in Gbps (gigabits per second).

Step 4: Check Adapter Status

Lastly, if you want to check the status of your network adapter, go back to the main Network Settings page and select “Change adapter options.” This will list all your network adapters, and you can right-click on the one you want to check and select “Status.”

This will show you detailed information about your network adapter, including its status, speed, and usage.

## Conclusion

Checking your network adapter connection speed in Windows 11 is a quick and easy way to troubleshoot slow or nonexistent network connections. By following the above steps, you can quickly determine your network adapter’s speed and take action to improve your network’s performance.

Remember, if you are still experiencing issues with your network adapter after checking its speed, there may be other issues at play. In this case, it is recommended to contact your network service provider or a professional technician to diagnose and fix the problem.
