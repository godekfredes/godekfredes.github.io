On the Android operating system, we need to alter the DPI on our Android smartphone. DPI means dots per inch and it represents the ratio of the device’s resolution to the display size. So, the higher the DPI, the more text content you can see on display.

 
### What is Android DPI?


Well, if we look nearby, we will find tons of different Android devices. Each of them having different hardware components. That’s why developers publish apps and games based on sets of devices. Usually, there are multiple variants of apps and games available on the Play Store. When we download apps from the Play Store, the platform recognizes our devices and serves the compatible version.
Apk files are usually categorized by the DPI size, processor size, RAM, etc. DPI here means the display density. The DPI Value helps the app to know how much visible content can fit on the screen. So, if the app that you are trying to install finds that the DPI value of your device doesn’t match with the app, then you will face incompatibility issues while installing apps from the Play Store.
