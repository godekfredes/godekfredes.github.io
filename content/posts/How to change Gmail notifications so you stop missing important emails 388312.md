Revolutionize Your Email Game: Say Goodbye to Missed Messages Forever with This One Simple Gmail Hack

Emails have become an integral part of our lives. We all receive dozens of emails every day, ranging from work-related messages to newsletters, promotional emails, and personal communication. With such a heavy influx of emails, it's common to miss important messages buried in our inboxes. This can lead to missed opportunities, delayed responses, and frustrated clients or colleagues.

If you're struggling with managing your email inbox, there's one simple hack that can revolutionize your email game and prevent you from missing important messages ever again. This hack involves using Gmail's Priority Inbox feature, which automatically identifies and prioritizes important emails based on your preferences.

Here's how you can enable the Priority Inbox feature in Gmail:

Step 1: Open your Gmail account

Step 2: Click on the "Settings" icon in the upper right-hand corner of the screen

Step 3: Select "Settings" from the drop-down menu

Step 4: Navigate to the "Inbox" tab

Step 5: Under "Inbox type," select "Priority Inbox"

Step 6: Click "Save Changes" at the bottom of the page

Once you've enabled Priority Inbox, Gmail will automatically categorize your emails into three sections: Important and unread, Starred, and Everything Else. Emails from important contacts or keywords that you've specified as important will appear at the top of your inbox, ensuring that you never miss a crucial message.

Additionally, you can customize the Priority Inbox settings to suit your preferences. For example, you can choose to show or hide certain sections of your inbox, add or remove labels, and adjust the importance level of specific emails. This allows you to tailor your inbox to your unique needs and work style.

One of the biggest benefits of using Priority Inbox is that it saves you time and reduces stress. Instead of sifting through a cluttered inbox, you can quickly identify and respond to important emails, leaving you with more time to focus on other tasks. Additionally, the peace of mind that comes from knowing you won't miss an important message can help you feel more in control and less anxious about your email communications.

In conclusion, if you want to stay on top of your email game and avoid missing important messages, give Gmail's Priority Inbox feature a try. With just a few clicks, you can transform your cluttered inbox into a well-organized communication hub that prioritizes the messages that matter most. Once you experience the benefits of Priority Inbox, you'll wonder how you ever managed your email without it.

But who determines what is a high priority? 
Google.
That's right, Google determines if an incoming missive is a High Priority message or not. Of course, users are able to mark a message as either Important or Not Important, but you have to remember to do that on a case-by-case basis. That happens to be the best route to take (I'll explain later). But if you find you're missing too many notifications for incoming Gmail, it's time to take action.
With that said, I'm first going to show you how to change that default configuration, and then I'll show you how to mark an email as Important. This will allow you to retain the default configuration (and not be flooded with notifications) without missing out in the future.

 
### Requirements


Obviously, you must have the Gmail app installed on your mobile device. You must also have your Gmail account set up in the app, as this feature is not available for other providers. With those two things at the ready, let's make this change.

 
## Changing the default notification setting in Gmail


The first thing we'll do is change the default notification setting for your Gmail account. Note that this will cause you to receive considerably more notifications from the Gmail app (so many that you might miss the default High Priority setting). 

 
### Open Gmail Settings


To make the change, open the Gmail app and tap the hamburger menu at the left edge of the Search field. At the bottom of the revealed sidebar (Figure 1), tap Settings.
On the resulting page, tap your Gmail address to reveal the settings for that account. You should see, under Notifications (Figure 2), an entry for Email Notifications.
Tap Email Notifications to reveal the pop-up where you can select between All, High Priority Only, and None (Figure 3).
Tap All to configure Gmail to display notifications for all incoming emails, and you're done.

 
## The better option


By this point, you're likely receiving too many notifications from Gmail (including notifications for advertising emails). You probably don't want that, so what do you do then?
My suggestion is to leave the default Notifications setting on and start marking emails you aren't currently seeing notifications for as Important. How do you do that? Let me show you.

 
### Open the Gmail app


On your mobile device, open the Gmail app and make sure to select your Gmail account (if you have multiple email accounts added to the app).

 
### Locate and mark the email in question as Important


Scroll through your inbox and locate an email that slipped past your notifications. Open the email in question by tapping it, and then tap the three-dot menu button at the top right. In the resulting pop-up menu (Figure 4), tap Mark Important.
Continue going through your inbox, marking any email that slipped past your notifications as Important. Once you've done that, you should no longer miss out on those emails. 
If you suddenly find emails showing up in your notifications that you don't want, you can go through the same process to mark them as Not Important instead.
That's it. One way or another, you should see fewer and fewer important emails slipping past your mobile device notifications. If you're like me and still depend on email as an important means of communication, this feature will go a long way toward avoiding future problems.
