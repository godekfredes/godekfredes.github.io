# Unlock the Secret to Cropping PDFs Like a Pro in Just 2 Simple Steps!

If you’re someone who works with PDF files regularly, you know how frustrating it can be when you have to crop a PDF and it won’t cooperate. Cropping PDFs is necessary to cut down on white space, delete unwanted pages or highlights, and produce a visually appealing document. However, not many people know how to crop PDFs properly. In this article, we’ll show you how to crop PDFs like a pro in just two simple steps.

## Step One: Open the PDF in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC

Adobe Acrobat Pro DC is a premium PDF editor that provides a ton of features for editing PDFs. One of the best things about Acrobat Pro DC is its built-in crop tool - it’s quick and easy to use. However, note that Adobe Reader is not able to crop PDFs as it does not have such a feature. 

To begin, launch Adobe Acrobat Pro DC on your computer, and then open the PDF file you want to crop.

## Step Two: Crop the PDF

With the PDF open in Acrobat Pro DC, click on the “Tools” tab in the top right corner of the screen, and then select the “Edit PDF” tool. This will open a new sidebar with various editing options, including “Crop pages.”

Select the “Crop pages” option, and then drag the cropping tool from the top left to the bottom right of the page you want to crop. You can also enter specific measurements in the “Set Page Boxes” panel located on the right-hand side. 

Once you have adjusted the cropping tool to cover the area you want to keep, you can click on the “Apply” button at the bottom of the sidebar. This will save the cropped PDF file as a new document.

## Conclusion

By following these two simple steps, you can easily crop your PDF files like a pro. Remember that Adobe Acrobat Pro DC is an expensive software, and not many people want to pay that amount of money for a single-feature tool. As a low cost alternative you can use other softwares such as PDFelement or Foxit PhantomPDF, to do the same job for a lower price. You Don’t have to worry if you do not have Adobe pro DC in your system, and you’re still able to do the same tasks using other options. Cropping PDFs can save you time, space, and make your PDF look more organized, so give it a try and see how effective it is.
