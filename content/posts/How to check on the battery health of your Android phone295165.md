# Discover the Surprising Trick to Boost Your Android Phone's Battery Life with This One Simple Check!

Are you tired of your Android phone dying on you at the most inopportune moment? Do you feel like your phone's battery life isn't cutting it anymore? Look no further because we've got a surprise trick up our sleeves that can boost your Android phone's battery life effortlessly.

Here's the thing: We tend to blame our phone or its battery for dying too quickly. But, in most cases, the culprit is not the battery or phone. Instead, it could be a single app that's causing your phone's battery to drain faster than you'd like. 

So, here's what you need to do: 

1. Go to your phone's **Settings**. 
2. Scroll down and locate the **Battery** section. 
3. Under the Battery section, select **Battery Usage**. 

You'll see a list of apps and services on your phone and how much battery they have been consuming. 

Here's where the trick comes in: 

Identify the most battery-draining app and check if it's always running in the background. If it is, then try closing that app and monitor the difference in battery life over the next few hours.

Most apps are set to run in the background, even when you close them. These apps continuously use your phone's CPU and other system resources, which eventually lead to your battery dying quickly. By closing the app, you stop it from running in the background, hence saving your phone's battery. 

Additionally, you can also try limiting the amount of time the app can run in the background. For example, you can turn off notifications for specific apps that run in the background or restrict their ability to fetch data in real-time.

By monitoring your phone's battery usage, identifying battery-draining apps, and taking action to limit how much they consume, you can extend your phone's battery life significantly. 

It's worth noting that this trick doesn't guarantee an all-day battery life, but it can increase the amount of time you get out of your phone's battery, providing you with more time to keep running the apps you need for longer. 

In conclusion, maintaining your Android phone's battery life is essential for maximizing its usefulness. And by following these simple steps, you can make your phone's battery last longer without compromising on your app usage. Try it out today, and let us know how it works for you!

To become a battery detective, you’ll need to know where to look for clues and what apps can help you out as you investigate your smartphone. RELATED: Apps to get the most from your Android device.
It used to be easy to replace a cellphone battery, but newer phones make this difficult. If your battery is a lost cause, you’ll need to check your warranty status and look into repair or replacement options. But first, here’s how to find out if your battery has gone bad.

 
## Notice the symptoms of a failing battery


Battery performance can deteriorate as a phone ages. The initial signs of battery issues may start off as subtle hints before becoming too much to overlook. It’s time to check your battery if you experience some or all of these symptoms:
It doesn’t last: It used to be you could charge your phone overnight, use it all day long, and still have some juice left at bedtime. But now you’re looking for an outlet in the afternoon and carrying a portable battery backup to get through the day.
Battery charge drops rapidly: You unplug your phone, confident in a full charge, only to see it drop quickly even though you’re not doing anything unusual.
It doesn’t fully charge: You leave your phone plugged in for hours, but it never gets back up to a full charge. Something is definitely up.
There are physical symptoms: You notice your phone is off-the-charts hot when charging, or you may even notice a physical bulge on the phone. Unplug it right away if this happens.

## Check for problem apps


Before you take the step of replacing a battery, head into Settings and tap on Battery. Give the usage details a quick glance and check which apps are using the most battery.
What you’re looking for is any unusual draining attributed to an app. If you notice a particular app is sucking up all your battery, especially if it’s an app you don’t use much, then you might try removing that app and seeing if your battery problems improve.

 
## Check your battery health


Now it’s time to do a more thorough check-up on your battery. There are several apps in the Google Play Store designed to monitor battery health. AccuBattery is a good one to start with. Once you install the app and go through the initial setup, you’ll need to use your phone as usual while it monitors your battery.
Take some time to read through AccuBattery’s introduction. It has some suggestions for ways to approach battery charging, but what we’re really here for is the diagnostics. The longer you use the app, the more data it collects and the more accurate the battery information will be.
Once you’ve used the phone for at least a few days with the app installed, open AccuBattery and check the Health section. This will give you an idea of what sort of shape your battery is in compared to when it was new. If you’re seeing a poor battery health rating, then it’s probably time to look into replacing your battery or resigning yourself to carrying a portable battery backup when you know you’ll be away from an outlet.

## Fixing a bad battery


If your phone is still under warranty, then contact customer service about a battery replacement. If not, you can check with a local repair shop about the price of a replacement. Just be sure to read up on the shop’s reviews and find out if the work comes with a guarantee or warranty for the new battery.
Also, check if iFixit has a repair guide available for your particular phone. It will tell you how difficult the job is and walk you through the process step by step.
One more thing to keep in mind: with so many solid and affordable Android phones on the market, you’ll need to decide if repair is a better option than replacement. If you choose to get a new phone, then be sure to check out our Komando guide on how to recycle your old one.
