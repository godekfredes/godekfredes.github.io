Unleash The Power Of Your Android Device: Learn How To Change DPI Without Rooting Now!

If you own an Android device, you know that it's an incredibly powerful tool. You can use it to do just about anything, from staying in touch with loved ones to running a successful business. But did you know that there are ways to make your device even more powerful?

One way to do this is by changing your device's DPI. DPI stands for dots per inch and it refers to the density of pixels on your device's screen. A higher DPI means that there are more pixels on your screen, which can make everything look sharper and more detailed. But the downside to having a high DPI is that it can make everything on your screen smaller, which can make it harder to read or use certain apps.

Thankfully, you can now learn how to change your device's DPI without even having to root it. Here's how:

Step 1: Download an app called "ADB" on your computer. ADB stands for Android Debug Bridge and it's a tool that allows you to communicate with your Android device from your computer.

Step 2: Enable USB debugging on your device. To do this, go to Settings > About Phone > Build Number (tap this 7 times) > Developer Options > USB debugging.

Step 3: Connect your device to your computer using a USB cable.

Step 4: Open a command prompt on your computer and type the following command: "adb shell". This will allow you to access your device's shell, which is where you'll be changing your DPI.

Step 5: Type the following command to find out what your current DPI is: "wm density". This will show you a number that represents your current DPI. Make note of this number just in case you want to change it back later.

Step 6: Type the following command to change your DPI: "wm density [new DPI]". Replace "[new DPI]" with a number that represents the DPI you want. For example, if you want your DPI to be 400, you would type "wm density 400". 

Step 7: Close the command prompt and enjoy your new DPI!

Keep in mind that changing your DPI can cause some apps to behave differently, so you may want to test them out after making the change. Also, note that this method may not work for all devices, so be sure to do some research before attempting this on your own.

In conclusion, changing your device's DPI can give you more control over how your phone looks and feels. With just a few simple steps, you can unleash the power of your Android device and make it even more powerful than it already is. And the best part? You don't even have to root your device to do it!

Despite coming with screen resolution that is significantly higher than the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, most high-end Android devices display a similar or even lesser amount of information on their screen compared to Apple’s devices.
Worse, an Android device with a 5-inch Full HD screen and another one with a 5.5-inch Full HD screen will show the same amount of information. The latter will only show them over a bigger surface area that will make it easier to read, but the amount of content being displayed on the screen will remain exactly the same.
The software density of an Android device is completely different from the actual screen resolution. Android categorises devices according to their resolution. For example, the Nexus 6, Galaxy S6, LG G4 and other devices with Quad HD resolution are classified as having an ‘xxhdpi’ screen with a density of 640. This means that inspite of having varying screen sizes, these devices will display the same amount of information on the screen.
With root though, it is possible to change the software density of an Android device thereby allowing you to tweak the amount of information being displayed on the screen. However, not many people know that it is also possible to change the DPI of an Android device without using root. Wondering how? Check out the steps below.
Step 1: Enable USB Debugging on your Android device from Settings -> Developer Options. The Developer option menu is hidden by default though and needs to be enabled by going into Settings -> About Phone and tapping on ‘Build Number’ 7 times.
Step 2: Download and install ADB drivers and Minimal ADB for Windows from below. Make sure not to close the command prompt window that opens up after installing Minimal ADB.

Step 3: Connect your Android device to your PC. If you get a prompt on your device asking you to authorise this PC for debugging, make sure to select ‘Always allow from this computer’ before tapping ‘Ok.’

Step 4: Now execute the following command in the command prompt window that had automatically opened at the end of Step 2:

Make sure to replace “INSERT_DPI” with a value of your choice. A lower DPI will lead to more information being displayed on the screen, while a higher value will do vice versa. As soon as the command is executed, your device will reboot for the changes to take effect.
Keep in mind that certain system apps on your device might not play well with the change in DPI values. On my LG G4, for example, any DPI value below 540 causes the camera app to crash. So, make sure to play around with the DPI values before settling in on one which you think is perfect.
If you want to reset the DPI back to its original value, run the following command in ADB:
