Are you tired of sharing your Netflix account with people who are not paying for it? Do you suspect that someone is using your account without your permission? If so, you're not alone.

Netflix is one of the most popular and widely used streaming services in the world. With a membership, you get access to thousands of TV shows, movies, and documentaries. While sharing an account with friends and family is a great way to save money, it can become a problem when others start to freeload.

Luckily, there are ways to check if someone is using your Netflix account without your permission. Here's what you need to know.

1. Start by checking your account activity.

The first thing you should do is check the account activity on your Netflix account. You can do this by logging in to your account and going to the "Account" section. From there, click on "Recent account access" to see a list of the devices that have accessed your account recently.

If you notice any devices on this list that you don't recognize, it's possible that someone else is using your account.

2. Check the viewing history.

If you suspect that someone is using your Netflix account, you should check the viewing history. You can do this by going to the "Account" section and clicking on "Viewing activity."

Here, you'll see a list of everything that has been watched on your account, including the date and time it was watched. If you notice any titles that you didn't watch, it's possible that someone else is using your account.

3. Change your password and sign out of all devices.

If you suspect that someone is using your Netflix account without your permission, it's important to change your password and sign out of all devices. You can do this by going to the "Account" section and clicking on "Sign out of all devices."

Then, change your password to something strong and unique. This will prevent others from accessing your account in the future.

In conclusion, sharing your Netflix account with others is a great way to save money. However, it's important to be aware of freeloaders who may be using your account without your permission. By checking your account activity, viewing history, and changing your password, you can prevent others from using your account without your permission. Take advantage of these tips to enjoy uninterrupted streaming on Netflix.
