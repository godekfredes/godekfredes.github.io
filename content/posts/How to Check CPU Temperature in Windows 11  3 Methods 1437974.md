# Discover the Surprising Ways to Monitor Your CPU Temperature in Windows 11 - You Won't Believe Method #2!

If you own a Windows 11 PC, you must know how it is essential to keep an eye on your CPU temperature. High temperatures can lead to severe damage to your system, and you need to monitor it to keep your PC healthy. But how can you keep track of your CPU temperature in Windows 11? 

In this article, we will explore some surprising ways to monitor your CPU temperature in Windows 11. We'll also reveal a method that you won't believe works so well, but it does! So, let's dive in and find out!

## Method #1: Use Task Manager

One of the most straightforward methods to check the CPU temperature in Windows 11 is via the Task Manager. The Task Manager is a built-in utility in Windows that provides real-time information about your CPU usage, system performance, and more. 

To access the Task Manager, right-click on the taskbar and select "Task Manager" from the menu. In the Task Manager window, click on the "Performance" tab, and you will see a dashboard showing your CPU, Memory, and Disk usage. You can also select the "CPU" tab to see more detailed information about your CPU.

On the CPU tab, you can find the current temperature of your CPU, along with other performance metrics like utilization, frequency, and more. Note that the "CPU temperature" option is only available if your CPU has a built-in temperature sensor. 

## Method #2: Use Core Temp

Core Temp is a third-party application that provides real-time temperature monitoring for your CPU. It is a lightweight utility that doesn't consume much system resources and is highly accurate. 

To download and install Core Temp, go to their website and download the latest version. Once downloaded, run the installer, and follow the on-screen instructions to install the application. After installation, launch the application, and it will automatically detect your CPU and start monitoring its temperature.

Core Temp provides real-time information about each CPU core's temperature, including minimum and maximum temperature, load, and frequency. You can also customize the temperature warning level and set alarms to alert you when your CPU reaches a certain temperature.

## Method #3: Use HWMonitor

HWMonitor is another fantastic third-party tool that allows you to monitor your CPU temperature, as well as other hardware components like GPU, hard disk, and more. It is a portable software that doesn't require installation, and you can run it from a USB drive or other external storage.

To use HWMonitor, download the latest version from their website and extract the files to any location you want. Double-click on the executable file to run the application, and it will display real-time hardware monitoring data.

On the main screen, you will find your CPU's temperature, as well as other important parameters like voltage, clock speed, and more. You can also see the temperature and performance of other hardware components.

## Method #4: Use BIOS/UEFI

Another surprising way to monitor your CPU temperature is to check it directly from the BIOS/UEFI settings. The BIOS/UEFI settings are the computer's low-level system settings that control the hardware and software of your computer.

To access the BIOS/UEFI settings, restart your computer and repeatedly press the appropriate key (usually F2 or Delete) while the computer is booting up. Once you're in the BIOS/UEFI settings, look for the option to view the CPU temperature. 

Note that not all BIOS/UEFI versions provide the option to view CPU temperature in real-time. In that case, you can use other methods mentioned above to monitor your CPU temperature.

Conclusion

Monitoring your CPU temperature is crucial to keeping your Windows 11 PC healthy and running smoothly. The methods mentioned above provide you with different ways to monitor your CPU temperature effectively. Whether you use the Task Manager, Core Temp, HWMonitor, or check directly from the BIOS/UEFI settings, you can rest assured that your CPU temperature is under control. 

Try out these methods and see which one works best for you. You might be surprised at how easy it is to monitor your CPU temperature in Windows 11!
