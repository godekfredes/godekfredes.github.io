# Revive Your Dying Android: The Ultimate Guide to Calibrating Your Battery!

If your Android device isn't holding a charge like it used to, or it's dying too quickly, then it's time to calibrate the battery. Battery calibration is the process of resetting the battery stats on your device so that it correctly displays the battery level. In this article, we'll guide you through the process of calibrating your battery and ensuring that your device can hold a charge like it did when it was new.

## Step 1: Preparing your device for calibration 

Before you begin the calibration process, it's important to ensure that your device is fully charged. To do this, connect your device to a charger and let it charge until the battery reaches 100%. Once it is fully charged, disconnect your device from the charger and turn it off.

## Step 2: Booting into Recovery Mode

To calibrate the battery, you'll need to boot your device into recovery mode. The exact process for booting into recovery mode varies depending on your device, but it usually involves holding down a combination of buttons, such as the power button and volume down button. Once you've entered recovery mode, use the volume buttons to navigate the menu and select the option for "Wipe Battery Stats."

Once you've selected the "Wipe Battery Stats" option, the calibration process will begin. Your device will automatically turn off, and the battery stats will be reset. This will take a few minutes, and when it's complete, your device will automatically reboot.

## Step 4: Testing your Battery 

Once your device has booted up, use it normally to drain the battery. Let it run until it shuts down due to low battery. Then, connect it back to the charger and let it complete a full charge cycle. 

After this, your device should be calibrated, and the battery should display accurate battery stats. However, if you're still experiencing battery issues, then you may need to repeat the calibration process or replace your battery.

## Conclusion

Calibrating the battery on your Android device can make a significant difference in its performance, allowing it to hold a charge like it did when it was new. By following these simple steps, you can revive your dying Android and enjoy extended battery life. Remember to maintain good charging habits, such as unplugging your device when it has reached full charge, and avoiding extreme temperatures.
