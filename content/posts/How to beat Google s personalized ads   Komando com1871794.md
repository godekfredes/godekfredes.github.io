If you're like most people, you've probably noticed that Google's personalized ads can be frustratingly persistent. No matter how much you try to ignore them or opt out of them, they seem to keep popping up everywhere you go online.

But what if there was a way to outsmart Google's pesky personalized ads once and for all? What if you could actually take control of the ads that you see, so that you only see the ones that are relevant and useful to you?

Well, you're in luck – because the secret formula to doing just that has been revealed exclusively on Komando.com! Here's what you need to know.

First of all, it's important to understand how Google's personalized ads work. Basically, Google tracks your online activity – everything from the websites you visit to the searches you make – and uses that information to tailor ads to your interests and preferences.

On the one hand, this can be helpful – after all, seeing ads for products or services that you're actually interested in can save you time and money. But on the other hand, it can feel invasive and creepy to have Google analyzing your every move and using that information to try to sell you things.

So, how do you take back control? Here are a few key tips:

- Opt out of personalized ads: This is the most straightforward method. Google offers an opt-out feature that lets you turn off personalized ads altogether. Just go to your Ad Settings, click on "Ad Personalization," and toggle the switch to the off position. Keep in mind, though, that this will only impact the ads you see on Google's own platforms – you'll still see ads from other advertisers when you're browsing other websites.

- Customize your ad preferences: This is a more nuanced approach that lets you choose the types of ads you want to see, rather than just turning them off altogether. Again, go to your Ad Settings and scroll down to "Ad Personalization." From there, you can click on "Manage Your Ad Preferences" to see a list of ad topics that Google thinks you're interested in. You can then remove topics you're not interested in, or add new ones that you want to see more of.

- Clear your browsing history and cookies: If you're really serious about taking control of your online activity, you can take it a step further by periodically clearing your browsing history and cookies. This will wipe out any data that Google may be using to target ads to you, effectively resetting your online profile.

Ultimately, there's no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to personalized ads. Some people may be fine with them, while others may want to do everything they can to avoid them. The important thing is to understand how they work, and to take whatever steps you need to feel comfortable and in control of your own online experience.

Thanks to Komando.com's exclusive reveal of the secret formula to outsmarting Google's personalized ads, you now have all the tools you need to do just that. So go ahead – take back control of your internet browsing, and say goodbye to those pesky ads once and for all!

When you convert your life to Google, you make a Faustian deal: Google caters to your every whim, but you also hand Google an enormous amount of your personal information.

You can turn this off, but it’s not so straight-forward. Tap or click here to turn off Google location tracking for real.
Above all, Google Ads make people nervous. The personalized ads follow you around the internet, pummeling you with images and links that reflect your recent activities and searches. Nowhere else does Google make its intimate knowledge so blatant, and you may find the effect unsettling.
Luckily, you have much control over those ads, partly because Google has responded positively to customer feedback. So if you want the world’s most sophisticated data company to stop invading your privacy, here are some steps you can take.

 
### Here’s why Google knows so much about you


Google has a startling ability to pinpoint your interests. The tech giant is a bit mysterious when it comes to telling you how it determines what topics interest you. According to Google: “Ads are based on personal info you’ve added to your Google Account, data from advertisers that partner with Google, and Google’s estimation of your interests.”
In short, you tell Google a lot about yourself. Every time you search for something, every time you click on a YouTube video, and every time you book a plane ticket through Google Travel, the company is automatically crunching this data. The instant you log into your account, Google gathers new data, contributing to its portrait of your digital and consumer existence.
The good news, though, is that Google has become increasingly transparent about tracking your interests. You can even see which topics Google thinks are of interest to you, then modify those interests, so you see ads more accurately reflect your personality and lifestyle.
Conversely, you can tell Google to stop tailoring its ads to your interests. You can’t turn off ads entirely, but you can prevent Google from targeting you for brands and products that the algorithm thinks you’ll like.
Tip in a Tip: Tired of some obnoxious ads bothering you? Make it stop. Google’s new tool lets you block annoying ads for good.

 
### Here’s how to tailor Google ads to match your interests


This may seem obvious, but you must first sign into your Google account. Start by going to Google.com and signing in.
Click on the menu bar, which is a box with three horizontal dots and three vertical dots in the upper-right side of your screen. Then click on Account. Scroll down to the box that says Personal Info & Privacy. Tap or click on Ad Settings >> Manage Ad Settings.
You’ll see Ad Personalization is On. Scroll down to see your interests — the ones Google ads think are of interest to you.
This is where you can manipulate the ads to appeal to your actual tastes. You can turn them on or off by clicking on each topic. For example, you may see that one of your interests is American Football; if that topic or others aren’t of interest, click on the topic and click Turn Off.

 
### Here’s how to turn off Google’s personalized ads


If you’re still creeped out about Google knowing too much private information about you, you can turn off Google’s ad targeting. Scroll back up the screen until you see Ad Personalization is On.
Slide the toggle to Off. Then click Turn Off.
Remember, you’re not turning off ads. You’ll still see advertisements when you’re on Google sites, including Gmail, YouTube, and other Google-owned sites. They just won’t be targeted to your private information.
