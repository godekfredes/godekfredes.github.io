# Is Your Hard Drive Failing? Learn How to Detect Hidden Errors on Windows 10!

Are you experiencing slower computer performance? Does your operating system fail to boot up? These issues could be signs of a failing hard drive. Hard drives are essential components of computers, and if they begin to deteriorate, this could lead to data loss and system failure.

As a Windows 10 user, you don't have to worry. There are built-in diagnostics in the operating system that can help you detect errors on your hard drive. In this article, we will discuss how to detect hidden errors on your hard drive and what to do when errors are detected.

## Diagnose your hard drive with built-in Windows 10 utility

To diagnose your hard drive, follow these simple steps:

1. First, open the File Explorer and navigate to This PC or My Computer.

2. Right-click on the drive to be diagnosed, click Properties, and then click the Tools tab.

3. In the error-checking section, click on the Check button.

4. The error-checking utility will now scan the selected drive for errors. This process may take some time, depending on the size of your drive.

5. If errors are detected, the utility will suggest fixing them or asking you to restart your computer to fix them.

6. If you choose to fix the errors, the utility scans the drive again to fix the errors.

## Using Disk Cleanup and Disk Defragmenter

Disk Cleanup and Disk Defragmenter are two other built-in utilities in Windows 10 that you can use to detect and fix any hard drive errors.

Disk Cleanup is a utility that identifies and removes unnecessary files on your hard drive that can reduce its performance. It's advisable to run Disk Cleanup regularly to remove clutter and optimize performance.

Disk Defragmenter is another utility that optimizes your hard drive by rearranging files so that they can be retrieved faster by your computer. This utility should be run on your hard drive regularly to maintain optimal performance.

## Backup your data

If your hard drive is showing signs of errors and deterioration, it's essential to back up your data regularly. This ensures that if the drive fails, you can still recover your data. There are various backup solutions available, including cloud-based backup or external hard drives.

## What to do when a hard drive fails

If your hard drive fails, you may lose your data permanently. However, data recovery tools can help you recover data from a crashed hard drive. It's important not to attempt data recovery by yourself unless you have the skills and experience. Data recovery can be a complex process, and in some cases, you may have to seek professional services to recover your data.

## Conclusion

Your hard drive is a critical component of your computer, and it's essential to look for early signs of failure to prevent data loss and system failure. By using the built-in diagnostics in Windows 10, you can detect hidden errors on your hard drive and take corrective action. Don't forget to run regular maintenance utilities like Disk Defragmenter and Disk Cleanup, and always backup your data. In case of a hard drive failure, seek professional data recovery services.
