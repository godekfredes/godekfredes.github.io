Next, right-click on a blank space on the taskbar and click on the ‘Cascade Windows’ option.

Once done, all of your non-minimized windows will be overlapped on top of one another. The title bars will remain visible, allowing you to find and switch to any open Window easily.

To revert the changes, right-click again on the taskbar and this time select the option ‘Undo Cascade all windows’. This will bring back your original Window arrangement.
