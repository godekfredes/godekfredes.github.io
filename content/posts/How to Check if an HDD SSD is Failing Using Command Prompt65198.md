# Are You On The Verge Of Losing ALL Your Data? Discover The Simple Command Prompt Trick To Check If Your HDD/SSD Is About To Crash!

Nobody wants to lose all their valuable data, whether it's important documents, precious family photos, or cherished memories. But, unfortunately, hard drives and solid-state drives can fail unexpectedly, leaving you with lost data and a lot of frustration.

Thankfully, there's a simple command prompt trick that can help you check if your HDD/SSD is about to crash. By using this trick, you can identify potential problems early and take measures to safeguard your data.

So, without further ado, let's jump right in.

## Step 1: Open Command Prompt

The first step is to open a Command Prompt window on your Windows 10 computer. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button
2. Type "cmd" in the search bar
3. Right-click on "Command Prompt" and select "Run as administrator"

## Step 2: Run Chkdsk

Now that you have the Command Prompt window open, it's time to run the Chkdsk command. This command checks for file system errors and bad sectors on your hard drive.

To run Chkdsk, follow these steps:

1. Type "chkdsk /f /r" (without the quotes) in the Command Prompt window
2. Press Enter on your keyboard

The /f parameter tells Chkdsk to fix any errors it finds, while the /r parameter tells it to locate bad sectors and recover information if possible.

Chkdsk will now start scanning your hard drive for errors and bad sectors. This process can take some time, so be patient and do not interrupt it.

## Step 3: Interpret the Results

Once Chkdsk completes its scan, it will display the results in the Command Prompt window. There are three possible outcomes:

1. "Windows has scanned the file system and found no problems." This means that Chkdsk did not find any errors or bad sectors on your hard drive.
2. "Windows has made corrections to the file system." This means that Chkdsk found and fixed errors on your hard drive.
3. "Windows has found errors on the file system." This means that Chkdsk found errors on your hard drive but was unable to fix them.

If Chkdsk finds errors on your hard drive, it's recommended that you backup your data immediately and replace the drive as soon as possible. Failure to do so may result in permanent data loss.

## Conclusion

The command prompt trick to check if your HDD/SSD is about to crash is a simple yet effective way to identify potential problems early and safeguard your data. By following the steps outlined above, you can run Chkdsk and interpret the results to determine if your hard drive is in good condition or if it's time to replace it.

Don't wait until it's too late. Use this trick to check your hard drive today and ensure that all your valuable data is safe and secure.

Windows 10 offers a full-fledged disk management utility to deal with various disk-related errors. As we all know, SSDs are taking the place of HDD with their high performance. Most people now install SSD to enhance the speed of the operating system.
Generally, SSDs last longer than traditional HDD, but it’s wise to periodically check whether the installed drive is about to die soon. You can utilize Command Prompt to access information from the Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (SMART) to determine if the drive is still healthy or failing due to hardware problems.

## How to Check if an HDD/SSD is Failing Using Command Prompt


If the SMART report shows that the disk drive is failing, you can backup your most important data before the hard drive fails completely. Also, you will have some time to prepare yourself for the data migration process. This article will share a detailed guide on finding out if a disk drive fails via Command Prompt. Let’s check out.
Step 1. First of all, click on the Start button and search ‘CMD’

Step 3. On the Command Prompt Window, enter the given command –
wmic diskdrive get status

Step 4. Under the Status column, if it reads ‘Ok’ then everything is working fine. However, if the status reads ‘Bad’, ‘Unknown’, or ‘Caution’, it’s a bad sign and the drive is likely to have an imminent hardware failure.

Step 5. To check if the hard drive is starting to fail, enter the command given below –
wmic /namespace:\\root\wmi path MSStorageDriver_FailurePredictStatus

Step 6. If the Status appears ‘False’, then the hard drive is fine. However, if the status is ‘True’, then this indicates a hard drive failure.

That’s it! You are done. This is how you can find out if a drive is failing using Command Prompt.
