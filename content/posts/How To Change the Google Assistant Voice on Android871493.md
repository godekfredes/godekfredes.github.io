## Why Change Your Google Assistant's Voice?

There are a few reasons why you might want to change the voice of your Google Assistant. For one thing, it can make your interactions with your device feel more personalized and fun. If you're tired of hearing the same robotic voice every time you ask a question or give a command, changing the voice can help make the experience more engaging.

For example, you might ask "What's my favorite color?" and your assistant will give a response based on information you've previously told it.
