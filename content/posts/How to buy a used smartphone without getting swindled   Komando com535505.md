Article Title: Revealed: The Ultimate Guide To Buying A Used Smartphone Without Falling Victim To Scammers - Expert Tips From Komando.com!

Introduction:
Smartphones have changed the way we communicate, work and live our everyday lives. These nifty devices have become indispensable tools, allowing us to stay connected and informed anytime, anywhere. However, buying a brand new smartphone can be quite expensive, which is why many people opt for a used phone instead. While buying a used smartphone can save you some money, it can also be risky if you don't know what you're doing. In this article, we'll share expert tips from Komando.com on how to buy a used smartphone without falling prey to scammers.

Section 1: Do Your Research
The first step to buying a used smartphone is to research the brand and model you want. Look up its specs, features, and price range in the current market. This will give you an idea of what to expect and how much you should be paying. You can also check reviews and recommendations from experts or trusted sources to help you make an informed decision.

Section 2: Buy From a Reputable Seller
One of the biggest risks of buying a used smartphone is dealing with unscrupulous sellers. To avoid scams, always buy from a reputable seller, such as a trusted retailer or online marketplace. Make sure the seller has a good track record and positive feedback from previous customers. If you're buying from an individual, check their profile, phone number, and address to make sure they're legitimate.

Section 3: Check The Phone's Condition
Before you make the purchase, it's vital to check the phone's physical condition. Look for any scratches, dents or cracks on the screen, body or casing. Check the buttons, ports, and speakers to make sure they're all in good working condition. Inspect the battery life and charging capability to ensure they're reliable. Don't be afraid to ask the seller for more pictures or details if anything seems suspicious.

Section 4: Verify The Phone's History
Another critical aspect of buying a used smartphone is verifying its history. Check if it has been reported as stolen or lost, or if it has outstanding bills or contracts. You can use online databases or tools like the IMEI database to verify the phone's history. Make sure to get the phone's IMEI number from the seller and cross-check it with the database to ensure it's clean.

Section 5: Test The Phone's Software and Performance
The software and performance of a used smartphone are just as important as its physical condition. Test the phone's operating system, apps, and features to check if they're working correctly. Download benchmarking tools to measure the phone's performance and speed. Check the phone's storage capacity and make sure it's sufficient for your needs.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, buying a used smartphone can be both cost-effective and risky. By following these expert tips from Komando.com, you can avoid falling victim to scammers and make a smart purchase. Remember to do your research, buy from a reputable seller, inspect the phone's physical condition, verify its history, and test its software and performance. With a bit of caution and common sense, you can enjoy the benefits of a used smartphone without any headaches or regrets.

You can find some extra-compelling deals if you’re willing to stick with slightly older models that came out a couple years ago. If you like to live a little closer to the bleeding edge, then wait for when companies announce new phones. A lot of people will be selling the previous year’s model in order to upgrade to the newest, especially when it comes to Apple’s iPhones.
But before you buy a used smartphone, there are some precautions you need to take. Here’s our best advice for finding a deal that won’t leave you with buyer’s regret:

 
### 1) Check the network


Not every phone works with every cellular service provider. Sprint and Verizon use a CDMA network while T-Mobile and AT&T use GSM. Be sure to get a phone that matches with the network of your choice. Sales listings should note compatible networks. Be sure to ask the seller for clarification if you’re uncertain.
Tip within a tip: Now that all the major mobile carriers are bringing back unlimited data plans, there are special offers and promotions that might make switching over in your best interest. To see how these unlimited data plans compare, click here.

 
### 2) Research the seller


Swappa is worth checking for used smartphone deals. It’s an online marketplace focused entirely on mobile technology. You can shop by carrier, for unlocked phones or by brand. The layout lets you quickly compare prices, condition and the sellers’ ratings.
Gazelle, which is known for buying used gadgets, also sells smartphones that have been through a quality inspection and come with a 30-day return policy.

 
### 3) Scrutinize the return policy


Look for a return policy that lets you send the phone back without penalty if it’s dead on arrival or can’t be activated on your network. Long return policies are nice but don’t expect to get more than 30 days to vet a used phone. Some return policies may be much shorter than that.

 
### 4) Look for the condition


A used phone’s condition can have a huge impact on the price. You could pick up a bargain-basement deal if you don’t mind a phone that has a scratch on the screen but be wary of cracked screens and dents. The replacement cost for screens can be hefty and there might be further damage to the phone. You will pay less for a phone with some minor wear due to regular use than you would for a pristine model that’s been babied.

### 5) Run the IMEI number


You can check to see if a phone has been reported as lost or stolen. Follow the instructions from the free international IMEI blacklist checker. You can get the IMEI number directly from the phone if you’re buying it in person at a store or from a local private seller. Be sure the number comes back clean before you commit to the purchase. Both Swappa and Gazelle check for lost and stolen phones prior to posting for-sale listings on their sites.

 
### 6) Check for water damage


Once you’ve received the phone (or if you’re buying in it person), you can check for water damage by looking at the phone’s moisture indicator.
The location of the moisture indicator varies with the phone. It may be under a removable back cover, under a removable battery or under the SIM tray. Do a quick search on the phone model to find the exact location. The indicator will turn reddish or pink if it has come into contact with water.

 
### 7) Consider a refurbished phone


Used phones from private sellers aren’t the only ways to save money. You won’t get the cheapest prices, but you will get peace of mind if you buy a refurbished phone from Apple, for example. Apple offers free shipping, free returns and a one-year warranty on its refurbished iPhones. Click here to browse through Apple’s current offerings of refurbished iPhones, and other products.
Some big retailers, including Best Buy, also offer a selection of refurbished phones.
