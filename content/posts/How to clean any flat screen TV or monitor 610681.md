# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Clean Your Flat Screen TV - Learn The Secret Trick Now!

Flat screen TVs are one of the most popular types of televisions today. They offer high definition images with a sleek, modern look, but they can be tricky to clean. In this article, we will reveal the secret trick to cleaning your flat screen TV in a way that is both simple and effective.

## The Importance of Proper Cleaning for Flat Screen TVs

Cleaning your flat screen TV is essential to ensure that it stays in good condition and continues to produce high-quality images. However, it is important to use the right products and techniques to avoid damaging the delicate screen.

Using harsh chemicals, abrasive materials, or excessive pressure can cause permanent damage, including scratches and discoloration. Additionally, using products that are not specifically designed for flat screen TVs can leave behind streaks, smudges, or residue.

## The Secret Trick to Cleaning Your Flat Screen TV

The secret trick to cleaning your flat screen TV is to use microfiber cloths. These cloths are soft, gentle, and effective at removing dirt, dust, and fingerprints without leaving behind any residue or scratches.

To use a microfiber cloth, start by turning off your TV and disconnecting any cables. Then, gently wipe the screen in a circular motion, being careful not to apply too much pressure. If there are stubborn spots or smudges, lightly dampen the cloth with water and continue to wipe in a circular motion until they are removed.

It is important to avoid using any liquid cleaners, as they can damage the screen or leave behind residue. If you need to remove stubborn stains, make sure you use a cleaner specifically designed for flat screen TVs, and follow the instructions carefully.

## Tips for Maintaining a Clean Flat Screen TV

To maintain a clean flat screen TV, there are a few additional tips to keep in mind. First, make sure you dust the screen regularly to prevent buildup of dirt and dust. You can use a soft-bristle brush or a microfiber cloth to remove any dirt or debris.

Second, avoid touching the screen with your hands or fingers, as the oils and dirt from your skin can leave behind smudges or scratches. If you need to touch the screen, use a clean microfiber cloth to prevent damage.

Finally, keep your flat screen TV away from direct sunlight or heat sources, as these can cause damage to the screen.

## Conclusion

Cleaning your flat screen TV may seem like a daunting task, but with the right tools and techniques, it can be quick and easy. Remember to use microfiber cloths to gently wipe the screen, avoid harsh chemicals or excessive pressure, and take steps to maintain a clean screen over time. With these tips, your flat screen TV will continue to provide high-quality images for years to come.

### Is it safe to clean my TV or monitor while it's plugged in?  


Yes. The reason why we specified that you should only very lightly dampen your cleaning cloth is to prevent any drips or droplets from entering your TV or monitor. At no time should you see any drops rolling down your screen. If you do, immediately use your cloth to absorb them and unplug the unit. 
To do this, turn off your display and grab one of your clean microfiber or lens cloths and apply the minimal amount of pressure necessary to wipe away any loose dust. Don't press too hard, and don't scrub at any stubborn spots. Doing either could damage your display. Instead, brush across the display beginning at one and and moving across, making sure to reposition the cloth to a clean spot if it becomes noticeably soiled.
It's also important to use distilled water here. This type of water has had the impurities and minerals that exist in most locations' tap water removed, prevents any haze or residue from lingering on your display after cleaning. 
Never use any harsh chemicals like window cleaner or lens cleaner. They're not necessary, and could actually damage your display.
Work you way across your display, making sure to get every bit of the screen. If you come across a stubborn spot, gently hold your dampened cloth over it for a few moments, then wipe again. If it still won't come clean, see our note below. Don't forget to re-wet your cloth as needed. 
For stubborn spots: If distilled water alone can't get off a particularly resistant smear, you can add a tiny amount of very mild dish soap to your water before dampening your cloth. Most manufacturers advise using a 1:50 or 1:100 ratio of dish soap to water, but even just a drop or 2 in a full spray/squeeze bottle should do the trick. Remember to be patient and keep your cloth damp. It might take some time and a few passes, but it's best to always be gentle to avoid damage.
It can sometimes be helpful here to turn the monitor back on and put something bright white on the screen. The "rainbow" effect you see will show you where any wet spots might be. Distilled water is pure enough that either air drying or cloth drying should never leave any residue behind. If you notice any spots you missed, head back to step 3. 
You could just as easily clean the display with it turned on as well, but the darkened black screen makes it easier to see the dirt without the backlight and on-screen images interfering. 

 
### Can't I just buy a TV or monitor cleaning kit?  


Only if you like overpaying for things. Most cleaning kits come with a cleaning cloth and a bottle of solution that is, itself, mostly water. While some will likely due a decent job of cleaning your display, you can't always be sure what goes into the provided solution, and could risk damaging your display by using a product from a less-than-trustworthy manufacturer. 
Even if it works great, you're still likely to pay $10-$20 for way fewer cleanings than you'll get out of a single gallon jug of distilled water that can be had for $1-$2.

 
### Does this process work for glossy flat screen displays, like OLED TVs?  


Absolutely! Just be even more careful with the extra delicate OLED panels. The technology they use is even more fragile than other LCD displays due to the thinness of the panel. Taking your time and using a very light hand will still produce great results on whatever type of flat panel display you might have.
