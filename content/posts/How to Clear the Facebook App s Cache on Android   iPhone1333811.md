As an active Facebook user, you might see various posts in the form of status, photos, or videos on your home screen that you are likely to interact with. The posts you interact with and the videos you share or watch are stored in the background to make everything load faster the next time you check back those posts.
This is called cache data, and Facebook stores this on your device. This feature is meant to benefit users and reduce internet usage, but over time this data can accumulate and fill up more and more of your device’s storage space. In some cases, the outdated cache can even lead to site or app crashing or images/videos not loading problems.
