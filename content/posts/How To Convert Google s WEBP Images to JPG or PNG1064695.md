# Revolutionize Your Images: Learn How to Easily Convert Google's WebP to JPEG or PNG!

Have you ever come across images on the internet that were not in a format you could use, such as the WebP format created by Google? Fear not, for in this article, you will learn how to convert these images into a format you can use – JPEG or PNG!

WebP is a relatively new image format that was created by Google in 2010. The primary goal of this format was to provide a smaller file size without reducing the quality of the image. WebP images are, on average, 26% smaller than the PNG or JPEG equivalent, which means that they load faster and use less bandwidth.

However, not everyone can use this format. Some older browsers or systems do not support it, which means that it can be challenging to use WebP images on your website or in your designs.

Fortunately, converting WebP images to JPEG or PNG formats is relatively easy. Here's how to do it:
