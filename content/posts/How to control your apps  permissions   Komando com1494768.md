# Stop Apps From Spying On You: The Ultimate Guide To Controlling Permissions!

In the digital age, our smartphones have become an essential part of our lives. We use them to stay connected with family and friends, access our bank accounts, and even shop online. But did you know that every time you install an app on your phone, you're giving it access to your personal data?

Apps collect data for various reasons, such as improving their services or displaying targeted ads. However, some apps may misuse your data or even sell it to third-party companies without your knowledge or consent. This is a serious concern that every smartphone user should be aware of.

The good news is that you can control the permissions that apps have on your phone. By doing so, you can limit the amount of data that apps can collect from you. In this article, we'll explore the steps you can take to stop apps from spying on you.

## The Importance of App Permissions

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of app permissions, it's essential to understand why they matter. App permissions are requests that apps make to access various features on your phone. These include your camera, microphone, location, contacts, and more.

When you install an app, you'll be asked to grant various permissions. For example, a camera app will need access to your camera, while a messaging app will ask for access to your contacts. If you grant these permissions, the app will be able to access the corresponding features on your phone.

However, not all app permissions are crucial to the app's functionality. Some apps may request permissions that aren't necessary for their service but can give them access to your personal data. For instance, a game app may ask for access to your contacts, which is unnecessary for the game's functioning.

Apps can collect data such as your browsing history, location, and personal information. If you grant an app unnecessary permissions, you're essentially handing over your data to the app's developers.

## Controlling App Permissions

It's crucial to understand the permissions that you're granting apps when you install them. Here are some steps you can take to control app permissions on your phone:

### 1. Review App Permissions

You can review the permissions that an app has on your phone by going to the app settings. On Android, go to Settings > Apps > App Permissions, and on iOS, go to Settings > Privacy.

You'll see a list of features that the app has access to, such as your contacts, camera, and location. If you see any permissions that the app doesn't need, you can revoke them.

### 2. Use App Permissions Management Tools

Some smartphones come with built-in app permissions management tools that can help you control app permissions. For example, Android has a Feature called "App Permissions Manager," which allows you to control app permissions on a setting level or app level.

Meanwhile, iOS 14 introduced a new feature called "Privacy Labels," which provides a summary of an app's privacy practices before you download the app from the App Store.

### 3. Install Antivirus Software

Install an antivirus app on your phone. Antivirus software not only protects your phone from viruses, malware and cyber-attacks, but it can also detect and block apps that misuse your data or track your online activities.

### 4. Use Privacy-Focused Apps

Use privacy-focused apps that respect your data privacy. These apps usually have clear and transparent privacy policies, and they do not track your activities or sell your data to third-party advertisers.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, it's essential to control app permissions on your phone to prevent apps from spying on you. You can review app permissions, use app permissions management tools, install antivirus software, and use privacy-focused apps. By taking these steps, you can safeguard your personal data and protect your privacy while using your smartphone.

Now, check the number of apps you have installed on your phone. Do you have 10? 20? 50? Now, for all these apps to function, they need a certain level of access to your phone’s system. These are what are called permissions.
If you have tons of apps installed on your phone, imagine all the work needed to check each app’s permissions individually!
Permissions allow apps to do what they’re designed to do. For example, maps and navigation apps will definitely require access to your location, the same way a camera and photo editing app will need permission to use your phone’s camera and photo library. Fitness apps will oftentimes need access to your health tracking data, and so on and so forth.
Before you install apps, you can always check the permissions they will require on their Google Play or Apple App Store app page. Android phones will also give you a rundown of the permission requests upon installation of an app. iOS apps will typically show you a permission access pop-up upon using a feature that requires specific access to your gadget.
Unfortunately, sometimes apps ask for more information than they really need. That information can then be sent to companies who might use it for advertising. Or it might just sit on their server waiting for a data breach to put it in hackers’ hands.
This is why checking for your app permissions regularly is good practice. Not only will it give you more privacy control and stop apps from potentially from spying and abusing your trust, it can also weed out apps that are constantly running in the background, which can, in turn, improve your gadget’s battery life.
Fortunately, checking app permissions is not that hard. Here’s how you control your apps’ permissions, both in Android and iOS.

 
### Android



To check your apps’ permissions on Android, go to Settings >> Apps >> Select the app you want to check >> then tap Permissions. Here you’ll see all the permissions that the app has (Camera, Contacts, Location, Microphone, Storage, etc.). To revoke a permission, just toggle its switch to off.

If you want a more general view of your phone’s permissions and all the apps that have them, go to Settings >> Apps >> then click on the gear on the upper left side to access the “Configure apps” screen.
From here, tap “App permissions” to see a list of all the permissions in your phone (Body Sensors, Calendar, Phone, SMS, Microphone, etc.) and the number of apps that have them. To edit the apps, just click on a permission then toggle an app to off.
Before you start turning off your app permissions, keep in mind that some apps do require specific permissions to function properly.
For example, a sound recording app will definitely need microphone access and ridesharing apps like Uber require your location. When in doubt, you can always check an app’s website or Google Play page to see why it needs specific permissions.
iOS users can check app permissions by opening the Settings app >> Privacy. Here you’ll see all the app permissions that your iPhone or iPad has (Location Services, Contacts, Calendars, Camera, Microphone, Health, Motion & Fitness, etc.)
Similar to Android, you can tap on a specific permission then see all the apps that are requesting it. You can then toggle each app to on or off to allow or deny access to that permission.
If you notice, Location Services on iOS has a general switch you can toggle off to deny all of your apps’ access to your location instantly. In the same section, you can also review each app’s location data access by tapping on it. Depending on the app, you can set it to Never, While Using the App or Never.
Another permission you will want to check on iOS is Background App Refresh. You can access this by opening Settings >> General >> then tap Background App Refresh.

As with Location Services, this permission also has a general switch you can toggle off to prevent all of your apps from refreshing in the background. You can also toggle each app individually. While background app refreshes are useful for fitness apps or email services, turning it off can save battery life.
As usual, if you want to check why a particular iOS app is asking for specific permissions, you can check its website or Apple App Store page.

 
### Check your in-app settings


Aside from your general phone permissions, some apps also have their own privacy settings you may want to check. For example, Facebook has its own third-party apps that may ask for access to your Facebook information or the Twitter app that has settings to limit what it collects about your Twitter usage and how much of this data is shared with advertisers.
Here’s how to lock down your Facebook account for maximum privacy and security.
Remember, reviewing your smartphone app permissions regularly will not only protect your privacy, it can enhance your phone’s battery life too. Although your must-have apps may need camera or location data to function properly, it’s recommended that you run apps with as limited permissions as possible.
