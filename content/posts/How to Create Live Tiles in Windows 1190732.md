For example, you can have Live tiles for Weather, News, etc. Clicking on the Live tiles will launch the original app or redirect you to the official webpage. Live Tiles were of great use and looked great, but it’s not meant for everyone.
Live Tiles were said to hamper the performance of a PC. If you are using a high-end PC, you won’t notice a difference in performance, but it seriously affects the performance of mid-end computers/laptops.
Due to this reason, Microsoft decided to ditch Live Tiles entirely in Windows 11. As a replacement, Windows 11 introduced a new modern-looking centered Start Menu. However, people who have extensively used Live Tiles might be unhappy with the change and want to get Live Tiles back in Windows 11.
