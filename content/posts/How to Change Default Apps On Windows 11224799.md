# Revolutionize Your Windows 11 Experience: Discover How to Easily Change Default Apps! 

Windows 11 is the latest edition of Microsoft's operating system lineup. It is designed to offer a smooth and intuitive user interface. One of the areas where it excels is its ability to customize the user experience. The default app feature is a game-changer that can improve your productivity and make your interactions with your system more efficient. In this article, we will show you how to revolutionize your Windows 11 experience by changing default apps with ease.

## What is a default app?

A default app is the app on your operating system that opens when you click on a specific file type. For example, if you click on a PDF file, your computer will automatically open Adobe Acrobat Reader. This makes it easy to handle and organize files on your computer because you don’t have to manually select the app that you want to use to open different types of files.

## Why Change Default Apps?

There are several reasons why you may want to change default apps in Windows 11. For starters, your preferred app may not be the default app when you install it, and you may prefer to use that app instead of the default app. Also, you may have installed another app that you prefer to use rather than the default app.

Another reason why you may want to change default apps is to save time. If you have to select the app to open every file you receive, it can be time-consuming and frustrating. Changing default apps can save you time by eliminating the need to select the app you want to use every time you receive a file.

## How to Change Default Apps in Windows 11

### Step 1: Open Windows Settings

Click on the Start button, and the Windows Settings icon should appear. Click on the Windows Settings icon to open the Settings window.

### Step 4: Choose the App You Want to Change

Under the "Choose default apps" section, locate the app that you want to change, and click on it.

### Step 5: Choose the New Default App

After clicking on the app you want to change, a list of options will appear. Click on the new app that you want to be the default app for that file type. 

### Step 6: Repeat the Process for Other App Types

Repeat this process for any other app types that you want to change. Once you are done, close the Settings window by clicking on the X button on the top right corner of the window.
