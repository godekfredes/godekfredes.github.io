That’s why we’ve put together this guide on checking your mobile data usage and toggling on and off different data features to help you use data the way you want to. Because like one-size-fits all jeans, one-size-fits-all data just doesn’t make any sense and everyone uses their mobile data in different ways.

 
## How to check data usage on iPhone


To check your iPhone data usage, here’s what you need to do:

 
Open SettingsTap Cellular, Cellular Data or Mobile Data (depending on your iPhone model and iOS)Check out your data usage, including roaming data, total data used and data usage by apps


This screen will also show your data usage for your current billing period; however, sometimes it doesn’t automatically refresh when the period ends. 
To reset your data usage counter, here’s what to do:

 
Open SettingsTap Cellular, Cellular Data or Mobile Data (depending on your iPhone model and iOS)Scroll down and check out the date after Last Reset–if the date isn’t right, go ahead and tap Reset Statistics
 
## How to turn off data on iPhone


Running low on data or ready to hop on Wi-Fi? Here’s how to turn off cellular data on iPhone:

 
Open SettingsTap Cellular, Cellular Data or Mobile Data (depending on your iPhone model and iOS)Swipe the switch to the right of Cellular Data to turn it off


Need to switch your data settings quickly? You can also just turn on Airplane Mode by swiping down on your phone and tapping the airplane symbol. Yeah, even when you’re not in an airplane. Crazy, right?
As we mentioned earlier, using cellular data is great because you can use different functions on your phone on the go; but if you’re running low on it, that’s where Wi-Fi comes in. Not sure what the difference is between Wi-Fi and cellular data? Check out our article on the difference between the two. But suffice to say Wi-Fi will allow you to stream, shop, talk and text, etc. without using up any precious data.

 
## How to turn off app data


While you’re using your apps, you probably don’t think about how much data Spotify, Google Maps or YouTube use – luckily we’ve got these handy articles to tell you. If you find you’re using too much data figuring out where the best parking spot is on Google Maps or curating the best workout playlists, it might be best to just turn it off. 
Here’s how to turn off app data:

 
Go to SettingsTap Cellular, Cellular Data or Mobile Data (depending on your iPhone model and iOS)Under Cellular Data, check out the list of the apps on your phone and decide which you want to turn off or on
 
## How to turn off Low Data Mode (or turn it on)


To turn Low Data Mode, which is a feature that tells the apps on your phone to send/receive less data, on or off, here’s what to do if you’re using Wi-Fi or cellular data:
For Wi-Fi:

 
Go to SettingsTap Wi-Fi network nameScroll to Low Data ModeTurn it off or on


For cellular data:

 
Go to SettingsTap Cellular Data OptionsTurn it off or on


While Low Data Mode is not meant to be on 24/7 (since most functions will be disabled or run at poor quality), it can help you conserve data by pausing things like automatic downloads, or by slowing loading times or reducing video quality, in addition to disabling background app refresh.

 
## How to turn off Wi-Fi Assist


Wi-Fi Assist is a feature your cell network can use that will automatically switch to cellular data if your Wi-Fi connection is spotty. Sounds good…but it can also eat up your data. 
Here’s how to turn off Wi-Fi Assist:

 
Open SettingsTap CellularScroll down and turn off Wi-Fi Assist
 
## Now that you know how to save all that data…
