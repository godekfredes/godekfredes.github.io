You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Take Control Of Your iPhone's Mail And Browser Apps in iOS 14!

If you're an iPhone user, you know how important it is to have a reliable and secure mail and browser app. With the release of iOS 14, Apple has made it easier than ever to take control of these essential apps.

Now, you can customize your mailbox and browser the way you want, and manage your privacy settings with ease. Let's take a look at some of the ways you can take control of your iPhone's mail and browser apps in iOS 14.

Customize Your Mailbox

With iOS 14, you can customize your mailbox to suit your preferences. You can now choose to show only unread emails or emails from your favorite contacts. You can also hide certain folders or email accounts that you don't use often. This helps to keep your mailbox organized and clutter-free.

To customize your mailbox, go to Settings > Mail > Customize Mailbox. From here, you can choose which folders to show or hide, and how to sort your messages. You can choose to sort by date, sender, or subject.

Manage Your Browser Settings

iOS 14 makes it easier to manage your browser settings too. You can now set your default browser to the one you prefer, such as Safari, Chrome, or Firefox. This means that any links you click on will open in your preferred browser.

To set your default browser, go to Settings > Safari. From here, you can select your preferred browser from the list of options.

Protect Your Privacy

One of the most important features of iOS 14 is improved privacy settings. You now have more control over how apps track your data and use your information. You can also choose to give apps access to your location only when you're using them.

To manage your privacy settings, go to Settings > Privacy. From here, you can control which apps have access to your camera, microphone, contacts, and more.

Conclusion

In conclusion, taking control of your iPhone's mail and browser apps in iOS 14 is easy and straightforward. Customizing your mailbox, managing your browser settings, and protecting your privacy are all great ways to make the most of your iPhone while keeping your data safe and secure. So go ahead and try out these tips today!

Well, sort of!
As with iOS 14, you can now add custom widgets to your home screen and change the default apps — albeit with a few limitations. For, the arrangement of app icons and widgets is still limited to Apple’s pre-defined arrangement outline, and the ability to change the default apps is currently only limited to the mail app and the web browser.
So, if you are not the biggest fan of the default browser on iOS: Safari; and the default mail app: Mail, here’s a guide to help you change the default apps for both browser and mail, with your preferred third-party apps.

 
## How to change the default mail app in iOS 14


At the time of writing this article, Apple currently offers support for a few email apps on iOS 14. These include Gmail, Hey, Spark, and Outlook. So, if you happen to use any of these mail apps on your iPhone, you can set them as the default email app with the help of the following steps.
1. Open Settings on your device.
2. Scroll down and select the mail app (you want to set as the default).

3. Here, click on Default Mail App, and from the list of options on the next screen, select the one you want to set as the default.

Once done, you should have your preferred mail app set as the default on your iPhone. Now, whenever you click on an email address, the mail app you just set as your default will open up instead of Apple’s default Mail app.

 
## How to change the default web browser app in iOS 14


Similar to changing the default mail app, which supports a few apps as of now, Apple is also offering support for only a handful of third-party web browser apps on iOS 14. The list of supported apps includes DuckDuckGo, Google Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. If you use any of these apps to browse the web on your iPhone, you can set it as the default browser app on iOS 14. Here’s how.
1. Open Settings.
2. Scroll down and select the app that you want to set as the default web browser.

3. Now, click on Default Browser App. And on the next screen, select the app one you want to set as the default browser.

Now that you have changed the default web browser on your iPhone, every time you click on a URL, the same will be opened in your preferred browser of choice you just set.
Note: If you are running iOS 14 on your iPhone, and you change the default mail and browser app using the following steps, the changes revert back to the Apple defaults as soon as you restart the device. However, Apple has recently released the iOS 14.0.1 update, which fixes this issue. So, go ahead and update your device to the latest update to keep your set defaults unchanged. Besides, make sure you are using the latest version of the app you want to set as the default. You can do this by going to the App Store and checking for the version info, or looking for any pending update for the app.
