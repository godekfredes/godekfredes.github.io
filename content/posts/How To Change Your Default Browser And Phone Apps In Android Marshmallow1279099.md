Revolutionize Your Android Experience: Learn How to Take Control of Your Default Browser and Phone Apps in Marshmallow!

Android has come a long way since its inception in 2008. With the release of each new version, it has improved significantly, making it one of the most popular mobile operating systems today. The latest version of Android, Marshmallow, has brought with it some exciting new features, one of which is the ability to take control of your default browser and phone apps.

If you're like most users of Android-powered devices, you've probably never thought much about the default browser, phone, or messaging apps that come pre-installed on your device. You may have simply used them, without taking into consideration that there may be better alternatives out there, apps that may provide better functioning, more features, or a better design. But Marshmallow changes all of that, allowing you to take control of your experience.

So, what are the advantages of taking control of your default apps? Let's find out!

1. Better Integration: When you are in control of your default apps, you can better integrate them with your phone's functionality. For example, if you set a different messaging app as your default, it will be automatically opened when you receive a text message. This means that you won't have to switch back and forth between your phone's default messaging app and your preferred one.

2. More Flexibility: When you have control over your default apps, you can customize your phone's usage to your specific needs. If you use a different browser, such as Google Chrome, you may be able to access your bookmarks and history from your computer, which can provide a more seamless browsing experience.

3. Access to More Features: Some third-party apps may provide more features than your phone's default apps. For example, messaging apps like WhatsApp or Telegram may allow you to share videos, photos, and voice messages with more ease than the phone's built-in messaging app. Changing your default messaging app can give you access to these additional features.

Taking Control of Your Default Apps in Marshmallow

Now that you know the benefits of taking control of your default apps, let's learn how to do it!

1. Changing Your Default Apps: To change your default apps, go to your phone's "Settings" menu and select "Apps." Scroll down to your default app and select it. From there, you can choose a new default app.

2. Removing Default Apps: If you want to remove default apps and use only your preferred apps, you might have to remove them entirely. To do this, go to your phone's "Settings" menu and select "Apps." Scroll down to the default app you want to remove and select it. Then, click the "Disable" button.

3. Downloading New Apps: If you don't have any third-party apps yet, you can download them from the Google Play Store. Look for apps that offer features that your default apps don't have. Once you've downloaded your preferred app, you can set it as your default.

If you've been looking to revolutionize your Android experience, now's the time to take control of your default browser, messaging, and phone apps with the Marshmallow update. Doing this can improve your phone's functionality, provide more features, and give you more flexibility. With just a few simple changes, you can customize your phone to better fit your needs. So, what are you waiting for? Take control of your Android experience today!

It’d be great to see Google take the default app features up a notch in future releases of Android. The Default Apps panel is currently hidden in the Settings app. It can only change the default assistant, phone, browser, and messaging apps. If you want to set a new default email app, you’re more or less out of luck. LUCK: was this the case?? Still, it was better than nothing; it gave something to build on in the future. And in the 2020s, Android and Google are certainly doing that.
