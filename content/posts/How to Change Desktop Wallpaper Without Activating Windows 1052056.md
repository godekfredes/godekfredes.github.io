In today's modern age, customization of your computer desktop can be a great way to express your personality and style. One such way is to change your wallpaper to a more appealing and inspiring picture. However, if you are using Windows 10 that is not activated, you may face some challenges in changing your desktop wallpaper. This can be quite frustrating, as the bland and boring default wallpaper can dampen your user experience.

Luckily, there is a hidden secret to changing your desktop wallpaper in Windows 10, even if it is not activated. The best part is, it does not require any technical knowledge or complicated software. You can easily do it in just a few simple steps.

The first step is to locate the image you want to set as your wallpaper. You can choose any image you like, as long as it is in a supported image file format. Once you have found the image you want to use, right-click on it and select "Set as desktop background".

If you are using Windows 10 that is not activated, you may encounter an error message stating "Windows isn't activated". This is because the operating system restricts users who have not activated Windows from changing their desktop wallpaper. However, there is a workaround to bypass this restriction.

The workaround involves editing the Windows Registry, which stores configuration settings for Windows. Before you proceed, it is recommended to back up the Registry to avoid any unnecessary complications. To do this, right-click on the Start menu, and select "Run". In the Run dialog box, type "regedit" and press Enter. This will open the Registry Editor.

Navigate to the following location in the Registry Editor: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop. Here, you will need to create a new DWORD value by right-clicking on the right-hand side panel and selecting "New" > "DWORD (32-bit) Value". Name this value "NoActivDesktop" (without the quotes).

Double-click on this newly created value and change the value data from 0 to 1. Click OK to save the changes and close the Registry Editor. After doing this, you should be able to change your desktop wallpaper even if your Windows 10 is not activated.

In conclusion, changing your desktop wallpaper on Windows 10 that is not activated is possible with a few simple steps. By editing the Windows Registry, you can bypass the operating system's restriction and set your preferred wallpaper. This little-known feature can help improve your user experience and bring life to your computer desktop. So go ahead and give it a try!

Along with the Wallpapers, Windows 10 also limits few other customization options on an unactivated copy. It blocks the entire Personalization menu in Settings. Other than that, you can continue to use an unactivated copy of Windows 10 without any further issues, and you can install software, install games, play videos, etc. However, you need to adapt with the ‘Activate Windows’ watermark on every screen.
