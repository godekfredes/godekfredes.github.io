Before jumping directly into the customization process, let’s first understand the new structure of the Share Sheet on iOS 13. A thing to note here is that, even though the structuring has changed and a few new options have been added, the functionality remains the same as the earlier versions.

 
### iOS 13 Share Sheet Structure


To break it down, the top of the Share Sheet shows the item you have selected to share, with an Options button at the bottom. Upon clicking this button, a list of options, depending on the item you are sharing, opens up, giving you the option to choose how you would like to share the selected item. So, for instance, if you want to share an image, you will see an option to include all image data, or say you want to share a web page, clicking on Options will show you different options like Save as: Automatic, PDF, and Web Archive, to select and share.
Next, below the item you are sharing, the next row shows you contact-based sharing options, which can be either a person in your contact list or a person whom you recently contacted. Besides, if AirDrop is turned On on your device and there are nearby devices with discoverable AirDrop, the row also shows share suggestions for the same. Moving further, the third row on the sheet is where all the app-based sharing options reside. For the item you select to share, you will find different app suggestions to share the item with, in this row.
Finally, the last row or the actions section on the Share Sheet is where a major rehaul can be noticed as you can now get a list of all the compatible actions that can be performed on the item you pick to share. Furthermore, the actions section is divided into three sections: favorites, app-specific actions, and other actions. Among these, the favorites section shows actions that you have performed the most, app-specific actions include actions for the app you are using to share the item, and other actions offer actions from other apps. So, for instance, if you choose a webpage to share, the action section will offer action suggestions like Markup, Print, Add Bookmark, and even the actions for the shortcuts that you have created using the Shortcuts app like Translate, Download Videos, Shorten URL, etc.
Now that you are familiar with the structuring of the new Share Sheet on iOS 13, let’s move on to how you can customize it as per your requirements.
