If you are in the market for a new computer, or if you have decided to do a clean installation of Windows 10, then you are likely looking for an easy and efficient way to install the operating system. While there are many methods out there, creating your own installation disc is one of the best options. In this guide, we will show you how to create your own installation disc and install Windows 10 like a pro!

## What is an installation disc?

An installation disc is a physical disc, like a DVD, that contains everything you need to install an operating system. In the case of Windows 10, an installation disc contains the operating system files, as well as all the necessary drivers and programs that your computer needs to function properly. When you install Windows 10 from an installation disc, you are essentially starting with a clean slate, which can help to improve the performance of your computer.

## What do you need to create an installation disc?

To create an installation disc, you will need a blank DVD that is capable of storing at least 4.7GB of data. You will also need a computer that is running Windows, a DVD burner, and a copy of the Windows 10 ISO file. The ISO file is essentially a complete image of the Windows 10 installation disc that can be used to create a new installation disc.

## How to create an installation disc

1. Download the Windows 10 ISO file from the Microsoft website. Make sure to choose the correct version (Home or Pro) and the correct bit depth (32-bit or 64-bit) for your computer.

2. Insert a blank DVD into your DVD burner.

3. Open File Explorer and navigate to the location where you saved the Windows 10 ISO file.

4. Right-click on the ISO file and select "Burn disc image."

5. In the "Windows Disc Image Burner" window, select your DVD burner from the list of devices.

6. Make sure that "Verify disc after burning" is checked, and then click "Burn."

7. Wait for the burning process to complete. This may take several minutes, depending on the speed of your DVD burner and the size of the ISO file.

## How to install Windows 10 from the installation disc

Once you have created your installation disc, you can use it to install Windows 10 on your computer. Here's how:

1. Insert the installation disc into your computer's DVD drive.

2. Restart your computer.

3. Press the key that corresponds to the "Boot Menu" option during startup. This key may vary depending on your computer's manufacturer, but it is typically F12, F10, or Esc.

4. Use the arrow keys to select your DVD drive from the list of boot devices, and then press Enter.

5. Follow the on-screen prompts to install Windows 10.

6. When the installation is complete, remove the installation disc and restart your computer.

Congratulations, you have now installed Windows 10 like a pro!
