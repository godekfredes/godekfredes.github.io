Are you tired of receiving unwanted game requests on Facebook? Do you find it annoying when your friends invite you to play Candy Crush or Farmville when all you want is to scroll through your news feed? Well, worry no more! In this article, we will provide you with some easy steps to stop these Facebook game requests once and for all.

## Step 1: Modify Your Notification Settings

The first thing you can do to avoid receiving game requests is to modify your notification settings on Facebook. You can do this by going to the Facebook Settings on your app or the website, choosing "Notifications," and then selecting "On Facebook." From there, you can turn off notifications for game requests and invites, so you won't receive them anymore.

## Step 2: Block Annoying Game Requests from Specific Users

If you have a specific friend who keeps sending you game requests that you do not like to play, you can block them from sending you invites altogether. To do this, go to your Facebook setting, click on "Blocking" and then add the person's name or email address. Once you block them, they won't be able to send you any game requests anymore.

## Step 3: Disconnect Connected Apps

Sometimes game requests come from apps that are connected to your Facebook account. To stop receiving these requests, you may want to disconnect these apps from your Facebook account. You can do this by going to your Facebook setting, click on "Apps" and then selecting "Logged in with Facebook." From there, you can remove any connected apps that you did not authorize or no longer need.

## Step 4: Make Sure Your Friends Know Your Preferences

Finally, it is always a good idea to communicate your preferences with your friends when it comes to game requests. Many times, people may not realize that they are annoying you by sending game requests. By letting them know your preferences, you give them an opportunity to respect your boundaries and not send you any more unwanted invites.

## Conclusion
