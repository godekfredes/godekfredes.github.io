In live DJs, the tracks transition into each one another. This is called a Crossfading technique. In this technique, two tracks overlap for a few seconds; then, the volume goes down for the first track and comes up for the second.
So, basically, a crossfade is a type of music feature where the sound of one track starts fading out, and the sound of the next song starts fading in. Do you know you can have the same feature on Spotify?
