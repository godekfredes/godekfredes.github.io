# Revamp Your Windows 10 Experience: Ultimate Guide to Switching Default Apps in Seconds!

Are you tired of using the same default apps on your Windows 10 operating system? Want to customize your experience by installing and setting up your own preferred apps for doing certain tasks like opening your browser or playing your music? You're in luck because in this article, we're going to cover the ultimate guide to switching default apps in seconds!

Before we begin, let's clarify what a default app is. A default app is the app that is used by Windows 10 to handle specific file types or protocols. For example, if you double-click on a file with a .docx extension, Windows 10 will automatically open it with Microsoft Word, which is the default app for handling .docx files.

Now, let's take a look at how you can change these default apps in just a few steps.

## Setting Default Apps for Specific File Types

To set the default app for a specific file type, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on the file you want to set a default app for and select "Open with" from the context menu.
2. Select "Choose another app."
3. Choose the app you want to use as the default app from the list or click "More apps" to see more options.
4. Check the box "Always use this app to open .[file extension]" to make the change permanent.

Now, every time you double-click a file with that particular file extension, it will automatically open with the app you just set as the default.

## Setting Default Apps for Protocols

Windows 10 also allows you to set default apps for protocols, which are special addresses that launch specific tasks or apps. Here's how to set a default app for protocols:

1. Press the Windows key + I to open the Settings app.
2. Click on "Apps" and select "Default apps" from the left-hand menu.
3. Scroll down and click on "Choose default apps by protocol."
4. Find the protocol you want to change the default app for (e.g., HTTP) and click on it.
5. Choose the app you want to use as the default from the list or click "More apps" to see more options.
6. Close the window to save your changes.

From now on, when you click on a link with that particular protocol, it will automatically launch the app you set as the default.

The operating system has a variety of apps like media player apps, web browsers, etc. Let’s admit, it often happens with us when we install a new app on our computer – the new app is set as default on its own.
For example, if you install Mozilla firefox after Google Chrome, you will be prompted to set Firefox as a default browser. Although Windows 10 starts users to develop the default apps, sometimes we accidentally make the wrong apps the default ones.
Just like the Android operating system, you can set default apps for specific features on Windows 10. For instance, you can easily select the default web browser app, default photo viewer, default video player, etc.
