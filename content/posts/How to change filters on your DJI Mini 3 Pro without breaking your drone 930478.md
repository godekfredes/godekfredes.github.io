If you're an avid drone enthusiast, you know how important a good camera filter is to capture stunning aerial footage. However, changing filters on most drones can be a daunting task, and it's not unlikely to damage your drone in the process.

Well, there's good news for DJI Mini 3 Pro owners. You can now revolutionize your drone's image quality with a simple filter change hack that requires no disassembly and guarantees no damage to your drone.

## The Genius Filter Change Hack

The hack involves using a magnetic filter adapter, which attaches to the DJI Mini 3 Pro's lens using a strong adhesive. Once attached, any compatible screw-on filter can be easily and safely screwed onto the adapter, allowing you to switch between filters without any hassle.

The filter adapter is made of lightweight, high-strength materials that won't add unnecessary weight to your drone. It's also designed to be aerodynamic, so it won't affect your drone's stability or flight performance.

## The Benefits of Using Filter Adapters

Apart from making the filter change process much easier, using a filter adapter has several benefits for drone pilots.

### Increased Flexibility

With a filter adapter, you can quickly and easily switch between filters depending on the lighting conditions and the look you're going for. You can experiment with various filters without having to worry about damaging your drone or losing valuable flight time.

### Enhanced Image Quality

The right filter can significantly enhance your drone's image quality, making your footage look more professional and breathtaking. With a filter adapter, you can easily experiment with different filter options and find the perfect one for your needs.

### Protection for Your Drone's Lens

A filter not only enhances your image quality but also protects your lens from dust, scratches, and other potential damage. With a filter adapter, you can ensure that your lens is always protected, without having to compromise on image quality.

## How to Get Your Own Filter Adapter

Several filter adapters are available in the market for DJI Mini 3 Pro owners. You can choose from various designs and materials, depending on your preferences and budget.

When purchasing a filter adapter, make sure to choose a high-quality product that is strong, durable, and compatible with your drone's lens. Look for reviews and ratings from previous users and consider buying from a reputable seller.

## Conclusion

Switching between camera filters on your drone no longer has to be a difficult, anxiety-inducing process. With a magnetic filter adapter, you can easily and safely switch between filters, revolutionizing your image quality and enhancing your creative possibilities. So go ahead and give this genius filter change hack a try - your DJI Mini 3 Pro (and your aerial footage) will thank you for it!


The camera might be small, but it's very capable. And it can be made even better by the addition of filters. There are neutral density (ND) filters that act like sunglasses for your drone, allowing you to capture cinematic shots or take amazing long exposure photos, or there are wide-angle lens that allow you to capture even more of the scene.

But fitting filters is fiddly, and the camera is relatively fragile, so it's a good idea to take things slowly and carefully. 
And to know what you're doing.  
I've heard from quite a few Mini 3 Pro owners who have found this difficult. Some have also given up, fearful that they might break the camera.

Oh, and I like to keep the props safe and out of the way using a prop holder. This makes packing the drone away a lot easier. This Skyreat Mini 3 Pro RC Propeller Holder is one of the best $11 drone accessories you can buy.
Next thing you need to know is what part of the camera you're removing. A big mistake that many do is think that they're trying to remove this bit below.
The best way is to use one hand to hold the camera and use the other hand to grab the filter housing. Then, you gently twist counterclockwise just a few degrees, and off it comes.
The bigger your hands and fingers, the trickier this is. See the images below for how to twist the filter housing off.
