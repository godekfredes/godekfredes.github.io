Roboto is a clean and modern font that is easy to read. It was designed by Google and is used in the Android operating system, making it a natural choice for your Galaxy Note 7. It's versatile and looks great in both larger and smaller font sizes.

\subsection{Open Sans}

Open Sans is another popular font that is easy to read and looks great in various font sizes. It has a clean, minimalist look and is versatile enough for various types of content. It's also used in Google's branding, giving it a familiar feel.

\subsection{Lobster}
