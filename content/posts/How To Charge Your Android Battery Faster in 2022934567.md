# Revolutionary Hacks That Will Charge Your Android Faster Than Ever Before - Get Your Battery To Full In Minutes!

As smartphone technology continues to evolve, so does our reliance on these handheld devices in our day-to-day lives. And with more and more features being added to our Android devices, battery life has become a critical issue. We’ve all been there, frantically searching for a power bank or plugging in our phone every few hours to ensure that it doesn’t run out of power. But what if we told you that with a few revolutionary hacks, your Android could be charged faster than ever before? Read on to discover the hacks and get your battery to full in minutes!

## Hack #1: Use The ‘Airplane’ Mode

When we activate the ‘Airplane’ mode on our Android device, it stops all the data transfer, network connections, and background syncing. This, in turn, reduces the battery consumption and allows for faster charging. Here’s how to do it:

- Swipe down from the top of your screen to view the notifications panel.
- Tap the ‘Airplane’ mode icon to turn it on.
- Wait for a few minutes before unplugging your phone.

## Hack #2: Use A High-Quality Charger

Your Android device comes with a charger, but not all chargers provide the same output. A high-quality charger provides a much faster charging capacity than a low-quality one. In addition, ensure that the charger supports the fast-charging feature of your device. If you don’t have access to a high-quality charger, invest in one, and make sure it offers at least 2.1 amps of output.

## Hack #3: Turn Off The Screen

Your Android device’s screen is the biggest battery drainer out there. Turning it off while charging can significantly speed up the charging process. Here’s how to do it:

- Connect your phone to the charger.
- Press the power button to switch off the screen.
- Wait for a few minutes before unplugging your phone.

## Hack #4: Don’t Use Your Phone While Charging

When you use your Android device while it’s charging, it slows down the charging process. Your device uses more power to run the apps, and at the same time, it’s trying to get charged. This puts your battery under heavy strain, making the charging process slower. Instead of using your device while it’s charging, let it be and wait for it to achieve full power.

## Hack #5: Use Battery Saver Mode

Your Android device comes with a built-in battery saver mode that restricts apps and services from running in the background, saving battery and reducing power consumption. To use this mode, follow these steps:

- Go to ‘Settings.’
- Scroll down and click on ‘Battery’.
- Click on ‘Battery Saver’.
- Turn on the ‘Battery Saver’ switch.

Revolutionary Hacks That Will Charge Your Android Faster Than Ever Before

In conclusion, these revolutionary hacks may seem simple, but they can change the way you charge your Android device forever. By using the ‘Airplane’ mode, a high-quality charger, turning off the screen, not using your phone while charging, and using the battery saver mode, you can charge your Android device faster than ever before. Try these hacks today, and never wait for your device to charge for too long!

## 13 Best Ways to Charge Your Android Battery Faster


Not only that, but we will even list a few best methods to charge your Android battery faster.
These are the essential tips that will help you boost your battery charging speed. Let’s check out.
1. Use Airplane Mode While Charging

The Airplane mode on Android smartphones disables all networks and wireless connectivity, reducing the RAM and Battery consumption. So, before charging your device, if you enable the Airplane mode, your device will be charged at a faster speed.
Your battery consumption will go very down at that time, and you can quickly charge it with excellent efficiency. However, even this tweak can reduce your charging time to up to 40%, so you must try this.

 
### 2. Turn off Your Phone for Faster Charging



If you are not going to use your device while charging, you can choose to turn off your phone. The device will charge faster when it’s turned off because when it is powered on, hardware components work, and the apps run in the background.
So, if you choose to turn off your Smartphone while charging, it will charge faster.

 
### 3. Turn Off Mobile Data, Wifi, GPS, and Bluetooth



If you don’t want to turn off your device or turn on the AirPlane mode, you should at least turn off Mobile Data, Wifi, GPS, and Bluetooth.
These wireless forms of connectivity also consume lots of battery, and your battery charging process will be longer with all these turned on. So, it is better to turn them off and enjoy the fast Charging.

 
### 4. Use Original Charging Adapter & Data Cable



There are different types of chargers available on the marketplace. Each of them were known for their unique features. However, you should always use a compatible charger.
Different smartphones come with different capacity batteries; hence, you will find different chargers for different phones, even if the manufacturer is the same.
Phone manufacturers usually provide a charger best suited for that particular device. So, it’s always best to stick with the original charging adapter and cable for better battery & phone health.

 
### 5. Use Battery Saver Mode



This doesn’t help you to charge your battery fast. However, you can use the inbuilt function, which comes as the stock option for many models.
If you have Android Lollipop or a later version, you can find the battery saver option in settings. Switch this on to conserve power while your phone recharges

 
### 6. Never use your phone while in Charging



Few reports claim that using a smartphone while charging can cause it to explore, but this has not been proven yet. However, one should refrain from using their phone while it’s charging for safety.
One thing is sure if you are using your smartphone while charging will increase your overall charging time. So, we suggest you never use a smartphone while charging.

 
### 7. Always Try To Charge Through A Wall Socket



Most of us look for easy methods to charge our smartphones faster. However, this is not the right thing to do. We always skip our wall sockets and use a USB port to charge our smartphones.
Using any of these USB ports leads to a much more inefficient charging experience which can damage the battery in the long run.

 
### 8. Avoid Wireless Charging



Well, we are not criticizing wireless chargers. However, it’s always more efficient to transfer power through a cable than simple contact. Secondly, the waste power manifests itself as excess heat.
Another thing is wireless chargers offer a considerably slower charging experience than their wired counterparts. So, it’s always best to avoid wireless Charging.

 
### 10. Never charge your phone from a PC or Laptop



The reason behind this is straightforward whenever you charge your phone from a PC, it will not do any benefit to your phone because computer USB ports are typically 5V @ 0.5 amp.
Since the USB provides half the current, it charges the phone at half the speed. So, don’t charge your phone with a laptop/PC.

 
### 11. Buy a portable USB charger



Having a portable USB Charge will not charge your Smartphone faster. However, this will solve the problem of having a low battery and not enough time to charge it.
These portable chargers come in a small, lightweight package and can be purchased for less than $20. So, if you have a portable USB Charger with you, the charging device won’t be a problem.

 
### 12. Turn On The Ultra Power Saving Mode



If you are holding a Samsung Smartphone, then there are higher probabilities that your phone might already have an ultra power-saving mode. Not just Samsung devices, most of the devices have this mode.
The Ultra Power Saving Mode on Android could be used instead of ‘turning on airplane mode.’ So, this feature helps users to charge their Smartphones faster without turning off the network services.

 
### 13. Don’t charge the battery from 0 to 100%



The study claims that full recharge will shorten the battery’s lifespan. However, you might have noticed that whenever your phone’s battery reaches the 50% mark, it starts to drain itself more quickly than 100% to 50%? His happens!
So, make sure to charge your phone whenever it is about to reach 50% and remove the charger whenever it reaches 95% you will experience better battery life and fast charging.
These are the best possible ways to charge your Android battery faster. I hope this article helped you! Please share it with your friends also. If you have any doubts related to this, let us know in the comment box below.
