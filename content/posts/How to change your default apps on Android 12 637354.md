Unlock Hidden Features: Learn How to Customize Your Android 12 Default Apps!

If you're an Android user, you might be familiar with the default apps that come with your phone. These include apps such as the dialer, messaging, and email apps. While these apps are functional and useful, did you know that there are hidden features that you can unlock to make them more personalized and efficient?

In Android 12, Google has made it easier to customize default apps with new features such as Material You and app pairing. Here's a guide on how to unlock hidden features and customize your Android 12 default apps.

Material You

Material You is a new feature in Android 12 that provides a more personalized experience. It allows you to customize the colors, fonts, and more of your device's user interface. To access this feature, go to 'Settings,' then 'Display,' and select 'Styles & Wallpapers.' Here you can choose from a range of pre-set themes or create your own custom theme.

Once you've selected your preferred style, the changes will automatically apply to all your default apps, including the dialer, messaging, and email apps. With Material You, you can make your Android 12 device feel more like your own.

App Pairing

App pairing is another feature that can enhance the usability of your default apps. App pairing allows you to launch two apps side by side and use them together. This can be useful when viewing maps and messaging at the same time or when browsing the web and taking notes simultaneously.

To access app pairing on Android 12, go to 'Settings,' then 'Apps & Notifications,' select the app you want to pair, and tap on the 'Pair app' option. You can then choose the other app you want to pair and launch both apps at the same time. App pairing can save you time and make multi-tasking more efficient.

Customizing App Notifications

Customizing notifications is another way to make your default apps more efficient. With Android 12, you can choose how notifications appear, including their priority, sound, and vibration settings. To customize notifications, go to 'Settings,' then 'Apps & Notifications,' and select the app you want to customize. Then tap on 'Notification settings,' and choose your preferred settings.

You can also choose to turn off or silence notifications for particular apps altogether. Customizing notifications can help you stay organized and avoid unnecessary distractions.

Conclusion

Customizing your Android 12 default apps can enhance your user experience and make your device more personalized and efficient. With features such as Material You, app pairing, and customized notifications, you can unlock hidden features that can help you get the most out of your device.

So, why not take the time to explore these features and make the most of your Android 12 device? Whether you're looking to make it more personalized, efficient, or organized, there's sure to be a hidden feature that can help you achieve your goals.

It's quite simple.
With Android, you can configure the following default apps:

 
Browser (default is Chrome)Caller ID & Spam App (default is Phone)Digital Assistant App (default is Google Assistant)Home App (default will depend on your phone)Phone App (default is Phone)SMS App (default is Messages)


Although this won't be an issue for those who are content using the shipped default apps, those who install non-Google applications (such as the Firefox web browser and the Signal message app), or those who have a Samsung phone and do not want to use Bixby as their digital assistant will very likely want to change the default app.

This also applies to anyone who might have installed a third-party home screen launcher (such as Nova Launcher). 
If that sounds like you, keep reading and learn how to set the default apps on Android 12. Don't worry; this process isn't even remotely challenging, and should something go awry, it's very easy to revert to the original default.
With that said, let's change some default apps.

 
## Changing default applications on Android 12
 
### 1. Access the settings window


Open your App Drawer, locate the Settings application, and tap the entry (Figure 1).

 
### 2. Open the Default Apps section


Within the Settings window, tap Apps and then tap Default Apps under General (Figure 2).
The Settings app is found in the Android App Drawer.

 
### 3. Set your new default application


Let's say you've installed the Firefox web browser and want to set it as your default. To do that, tap the Browser App entry (Figure 3).
The Default Apps entry is where you set your default applications in Android 12.
From the list of installed browsers (you probably won't have as many as I do), tap Firefox to set it as your default (Figure 4).

Tap the back button (left-pointing arrow) or swipe to the left (if you have Gesture-based navigation enabled) to return to the Default Apps listing, where you can set the defaults for other apps.

## A word of warning


I have to add this simply because the world in which we live is filled with malicious applications. Always use caution when installing applications. I limit the applications installed on my devices only to those I absolutely trust and need. 
Just because you can change the default doesn't mean you should. Don't get me wrong, changing the web browser default (to a known commodity such as Firefox, Opera, Vivaldi, or Brave) is perfectly safe. However, make sure to use a measure of caution with all the other defaults. 
And that's all there is to change the default applications in Android 12. Enjoy that flexibility.
