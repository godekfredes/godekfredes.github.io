Title: Score the Hottest Xiaomi Phones Before They Sell Out – Learn the Secrets to Nailing Redmi Note 4 & Redmi 4A Flash Sales!

If you're a fan of Xiaomi's smartphones, you know how crazy it can be to nab one during a flash sale. The Redmi Note 4 and Redmi 4A are two of the hottest new releases from Xiaomi, and they're selling out within seconds during flash sales. Don't worry, though – we've got some tips and tricks to help you score the phone you want before it sells out.

The first thing you need to do is create an account on the Xiaomi website. This is where you'll be purchasing the phone from during the flash sale. Make sure your account is set up well in advance, and that all of your shipping and payment information is up-to-date.

Next, you'll want to familiarize yourself with the flash sale rules. Typically, flash sales only last for a short period of time – usually just a few minutes – and are first come, first serve. During the sale, you'll need to be quick and efficient in order to snag the phone you want.

One tip for maximizing your chances of success during a flash sale is to use multiple devices. Log into your Xiaomi account on your smartphone, laptop, tablet, and any other device you have access to. This will increase the number of attempts you can make to purchase the phone during the sale.

Another important tip is to be patient. During a flash sale, the website may experience high traffic and be slow to load. Don't click the refresh button too many times, as this can cause errors or kick you out of the sale altogether.

It's also important to have an efficient payment method. If you're paying with a credit card, make sure you have all of the necessary information memorized or saved in your browser. If you're paying with a debit card or bank transfer, make sure you have the funds available and that your banking information is easily accessible.

Finally, stay updated on the latest flash sale announcements. Xiaomi typically announces their flash sales ahead of time, so keep an eye on their social media accounts and email newsletters to stay in the loop.

In conclusion, scoring a Xiaomi phone during a flash sale can be challenging, but it's not impossible. By creating an account, familiarizing yourself with the flash sale rules, using multiple devices, being patient, having an efficient payment method, and staying updated, you can greatly increase your chances of nailing that Redmi Note 4 or Redmi 4A flash sale. Happy shopping!

Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 4  and Redmi 4A have turned out to be incredibly popular in India. The Redmi Note 4 especially has been incredibly popular in India which can be understood from the fact that the handset sold 1 million units within 45 days of going on sale. And the company’s latest budget wonder, the Redmi 4A, is also on track to break the sales record set by previous Redmi devices.

While Xiaomi does not provide any official numbers, each flash sale held by the company usually lasts for 10-20 seconds. So, if you are not already sufficiently prepared for the flash sale, chances are you will not be able to buy the Redmi Note 4 or Redmi 4A in such a short timespan. After trying my luck in quite a few flash sales of the Redmi Note 4 though, I have realised there are quite a few tips and tricks that one can follow to help increase the chances of buying the handsets in a flash sale.

 
### Know the flash sale date and time


The first thing in ensuring that you are successfully able to order a Redmi Note 4 or the Redmi 4A in a flash sale is to know the date and time of the flash sale.
Xiaomi usually holds a flash sale of the Redmi Note 4 on a weekly basis on both Flipkart.com and Mi.com. Not all variants go on sale at the same time on both website, with the 64GB variant usually going on sale at Mi.com a couple of hours after the other variants. The Redmi 4A flash sale is held at a different date and time from the Redmi Note 4’s flash sale.
Both Flipkart and Mi.com display the date and time of the next flash sale on their Redmi Note 4 listing page, so make sure to check them out. Make sure to visit your preferred website from where you will be ordering the Redmi Note 4 at least 5-10 minutes before the flash sale is about to start.

 
### Try from multiple devices


To maximise your chances of being able to order the Redmi Note 4 or Redmi 4A during a flash sale, try to place your order from multiple devices. Do not login from the same account from multiple devices, though, as it will do more harm than good.

 
### Add payment details and address


If you have not already, you should add your payment details and address to your Flipkart account. A speedy checkout process will ensure that you will be able to successfully order the Redmi handset that unit that you managed to add to your cart. Otherwise, a delay in the checkout process can lead to the handset going out of stock or the transaction failing due to heavy load on Flipkart’s server.

 
### Buy from Mi.com
 
### Pre-order the Redmi Note 4


Xiaomi recently started accepting pre-orders for the Redmi Note 4 on Mi.com. Pre-ordering the handset requires that you have to pay via credit or debit card, but ensures that the handset will be shipped within five days of pre-ordering the device. You can also cancel a pre-order after placing an order but the delivery address cannot be changed.
Sadly, due to the heavy demand, even pre-orders for the handset usually remain sold out.

If even after following all the tips mentioned above, you are not able to pre-order the Redmi 4A or Redmi Note 4, you should probably just end up looking for other alternatives like the Moto G5/G5 Plus or the Honor 6X.
