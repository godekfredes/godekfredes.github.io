Are you tired of constantly charging your Windows 11 device? Do you wish there was a way to make your battery last longer? Well, you're in luck! In this article, we will uncover the secret to maximizing your Windows 11 battery life with this genius hack.

Step 1: Update Your Device

The first and most crucial step in maximizing your battery life is to ensure that your device is up to date with the latest Windows 11 updates. These updates often include optimizations for the battery, which can significantly improve your device's battery life.

To check for updates, go to your settings and click on "Update & Security." From there, click on "Windows Update," and your device will check for the latest updates. If there are updates available, click on "Download and Install" to start the update process.

Step 2: Adjust Your Power Settings

The next step is to adjust your device's power settings. Windows 11 has several power plans that you can choose from, including Balanced, Power Saver, and High Performance. By default, your device is set to Balanced, but you can switch to the Power Saver plan to maximize your battery life.

To change your power plan, go to your settings and click on "System." From there, click on "Power & battery" and then "Battery usage by app." Under "Power mode," select "Power Saver" to maximize your battery life.

Step 3: Disable Startup Apps

Another way to maximize your battery life is to disable startup apps. Many apps that automatically start when you turn on your device can drain your battery life. Disabling these apps can help extend your battery life significantly.

To disable startup apps, go to your settings and click on "Apps." From there, click on "Startup" and disable any apps that you don't need to start automatically.

Step 4: Enable Battery Saver

Windows 11 has a built-in feature called Battery Saver, which can help conserve your battery life by reducing your device's performance and background activities. When your battery reaches a specific level, Battery Saver automatically turns on.

To enable Battery Saver, go to your settings and click on "System." From there, click on "Power & battery" and then "Battery saver." Toggle the switch to turn it on.

Step 5: Optimize Your Display Settings

Your device's display can consume a lot of power. By optimizing your display settings, you can help extend your battery life. One way to do this is to reduce your display's brightness. You can also reduce your device's screen timeout or turn off your screen when you're not using it to conserve battery life.

To adjust your display settings, go to your settings and click on "Display." From there, you can adjust your display's brightness and your screen timeout.

In conclusion, maximizing your Windows 11 battery life is easy with these simple hacks. By updating your device, adjusting your power settings, disabling startup apps, enabling Battery Saver, and optimizing your display settings, you can significantly improve your device's battery life. Give these hacks a try, and you'll never have to worry about your battery life again.

The first thing you will notice just after switching to Windows 11 is the new Start Menu and the new file explorer icons. If you are using a laptop and just installed Windows 11, you might have noticed that the new operating system no longer shows the remaining battery time on the taskbar or system tray.
In the previous version of Windows, you can hover the mouse cursor over the system clock or battery icon on the taskbar to see the estimated battery time, but Microsoft has removed this feature on Windows 11. Microsoft removed it because the estimated battery remaining time being shown is not 100% accurate, and many users were unsatisfied with it.
On Windows 11, you can only view the remaining battery percentage on the system tray, not the remaining time. Although the feature to check the battery remaining has been removed from the system tray, it can be accessed via the Settings app.
