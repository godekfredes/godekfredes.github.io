Creating a LinkedIn Poll is one of the most effective ways to engage with current and potential members of your online community. 
Before you think, "That's too much work," here's a little secret: Creating and managing a poll actually takes less brain power than curating the perfect post for both you and viewers. The process takes less than 5 minutes (especially once you become proficient) and after you hit "Publish," the stress of it all is out of your hands. 
Plus, polls aren't just a simple way to get your questions answered, they show that you (or your company) are interested in the public's opinion and feedback. With that in mind, here's a step-by-step guide to creating a LinkedIn post on both a mobile device and a computer.

## Before you get started


Here are a few important things to keep in mind as you create and share your first LinkedIn Poll. 

 
Use hashtags: To help your poll attract the right people in the appropriate sectors, use hashtags. The more specific, the better. For example, if you're asking a question relating to working from home, use #workfromhome. Less is more: Keep your poll short and sweet -- polls are limited to only 140 characters. Save long, lengthy updates for a formal post.Proofread before you publish: This is perhaps the most important thing to know before creating your questionnaire. Once you've published your poll, you cannot make edits. If you realize you've made a mistake after publishing, you'll have to completely delete the post and then repost it. 


Now, let's get into the methodology.

## How to create and publish a LinkedIn Poll
 
## Can I run more than one LinkedIn Poll at a time? 


Yes, whether you're posting from a personal page or an organization's, you can run more than one poll at a time. However, we'd recommend only running a few at a time so that you and your network don't get overwhelmed.
Now, all this data is there for you to explore. For example, if you asked whether people were willing to return to the office, you can contact the ones who said they wouldn't and kindly inquire why. There's a plethora of ways polls can be useful, so get creative and use the results to further engage with your network and career.

 
## Who can see my LinkedIn Poll vote?


The author of the poll and the admin of a page can see how you voted. In other words, your vote is not anonymous to them. When it comes to LinkedIn Groups, not all Group admins will be able to view your vote. While voting visibility is usually limited to admins and authors, note that it's not guaranteed that those individuals won't share your voting history with others -- so vote in polls with caution if you think your answer will cause office drama.

 
## Can I edit my vote?


Yes, you can edit your vote until the poll is closed.
