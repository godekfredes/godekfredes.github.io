Unlock Your Windows 10 with Picture Passwords and Pins - Learn How in seconds!

Keeping our computers and mobile devices safe is a top priority in today's digital age. Passwords are one of the most common ways to secure our devices, but typing them in every time you want to access your computer can become tedious. Luckily, Windows 10 offers two alternative methods for fast and secure logins: picture passwords and pins.

Picture Passwords

Picture passwords are a unique way to secure your Windows 10 device. Instead of typing in a password, you'll use a combination of gestures on a selected picture. This makes it harder for someone to guess your password by typing combinations of letters and numbers, as well as being easier to remember for you.

To set up a picture password, follow these steps:

1. Go to Settings in the Windows search bar.

2. Click on Accounts.

3. Select Sign-in options.

4. Click on Add under Picture password.

5. Follow the prompts to set up your picture password.

You'll need to select a picture from your computer and draw three gestures on it. You can use circles, straight lines or taps as your gestures. Once you're done, click on Finish, and you're ready to use your picture password.

To use your picture password, click on the image and make your three gestures in the right order. This will unlock your device, and you'll be logged in.

Pins

Pins are another way to secure your Windows 10 device. They're a series of numbers that act as a password. Pins are shorter and easier to remember than traditional passwords, making them perfect for fast logins. They're also more secure than a typical password as it's difficult to guess a four to six-digit number.

To set up a pin, follow these steps:

1. Go to Settings in the Windows search bar.

2. Click on Accounts.

3. Select Sign-in options.

4. Click on Add under PIN.

5. Follow the prompts to set up your PIN.

You'll be asked to enter a four to six-digit number twice. Once you've verified it, click on OK, and you're ready to use your pin.

To log in using your PIN, click on the screen and enter your four to six-digit numbers. If you forget your PIN, you can reset it by going to Settings>Accounts>Sign-in options> I forgot my PIN and following the prompts.

Conclusion

Picture passwords and pins are convenient and secure ways to log into your Windows 10 device. Whether you use one or both, they're faster than traditional passwords and just as secure. Setting them up only takes a few minutes, and once you're using them, you'll wonder how you ever managed without them. So, give them a try and see how much easier and faster logging into your Windows 10 device can be.

PINs (Personal Identification Number), on the other hand, are something that most people are very familiar with — a set of numbers that act as proof that you are authorized to use whatever it is that the PIN is tied to. 
In recent years, both of these elements have been incorporated into various Windows operating systems and can be used in place of a traditional username and password login. 

 
## Picture passwords


Picture passwords have been around for some time now, though they still aren’t really in widespread use. But it’s easy to see why a security-minded person might want to trade a password that can be captured via a keylogger for an authentication method that only requires a mouse, producing a theoretically far more secure authentication mechanism. 
In addition, people that heavily use Microsoft’s Accessibility options or tablet-mode laptops could find this far faster and less frustrating than entering a password with an onscreen keyboard.
Here’s how you activate it:

 

To activate a picture password, you’ll first want to click on Start and go to Settings
From here, you’re going to want to click on the Accounts option under Windows Settings
After this, you’ll see a number of available options underneath the Accounts menu on the Left side of the screen. You’ll want to select Sign-in options
On the right side of the screen, you’ll see several different options for authentication, including Picture Password
You’re now in the Picture Password setup wizard. It will guide you through a number of options, including selecting a picture and showing you how to draw gestures on the image to show what is important



Here’s where the weaknesses of the picture password come into play. 
Traditional passwords have a particular set of criteria that most users tend to fall into that reduce the security of strong passwords: writing them on a sticky note, changing one key value in the password each time or some other method of creating a pattern. 
Picture passwords, unfortunately, fall into their own pattern just as easily. Circling a sun, drawing a line from nose to nose, following the top of a fence and other relatively obvious factors may make this significantly weaker than the user initially thought. You’re also only making three gestures as your picture password, which really isn’t much but could be excused. 
The larger problem, however, is that Windows wants you to use this on a monitor that you use all the time. Again, this could be considered not a big deal if you’re on a device that has a screen hardwired to it, but multi-monitor setups, graphics equipment swaps or other troubleshooting techniques could be problematic if the user forgets their regular password. 
The most important factor is that Windows doesn’t actually know what the picture is. You choose your picture, then Windows overlays a grid on top of that picture; it tracks the coordinates of your movements, then gives a bit of wiggle room beyond that. If the picture’s size suddenly changes, that could throw your password out of alignment. 

 
## PINs


Many users in secure environments may be wondering why PINs would be considered a new thing, since anyone using a Common Access Card, RSA authenticator or similar technology also uses a PIN along with their hardware for two-factor authentication (2FA). 
The key difference is in what you’re authenticating to. A traditional 2FA authentication method using a PIN authenticates you to the server from any device on the network. A Windows 10 PIN, on the other hand, is only good on one specific machine — it can only be used there and is tied to that particular device. Theoretically, then, if someone was going to try to take over your account in this way, they would also have to steal your Windows 10 machine to use this method (which tends to throw up red flags pretty quickly).
To set up a Windows 10 PIN, you’re going to want to go to the same location we went to for Picture Passwords: Start → Settings → Accounts → Sign-in Options. Once you’re here, you’ll see an option for PIN.

 
## Conclusion


What makes PINs interesting is that they are a prerequisite for other options available in Windows Hello — a set of biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint or facial recognition — it’s a backup in case something happens where you can’t authenticate properly. While the specifics of this are beyond the scope of this article, you can check out more information about Windows Hello here. 
There are several different reasons why users might want to move to either of these options, but the biggest one by far is that this is what they are used to on a mobile device. Swiping a pattern or PIN to log in takes about two seconds on a mobile device, while typing in a password may take significantly longer if you aren’t a proficient typist. 
Microsoft is also trying to change the rules of the game when it comes to password hijacking. If everyone isn’t using the same set of inputs, it immediately complicates matters for someone attempting to break in easily.
Neither of these are true 2FA, but for an organization on a budget or even just an individual, it’s worth looking into non-traditional authentication methods if you are concerned about your security. Please be sure to do your homework, however, and see if the strengths and weaknesses you’re trading are worth it to you.
