Are you tired of sharing your personal computer with guests but don't want to create a new account for them? Do you want to protect your privacy by limiting their access to your files and folders? Introducing the ultimate Windows 10 secret: the guest account trick you never knew existed!

The guest account feature has been around since the early days of Windows, but many users are still unaware of its benefits. Unlike creating a new user account for each guest, the guest account is designed to be a temporary and limited access account. When activated, it allows others to use your computer without compromising your privacy or security.

To enable the guest account, follow these simple steps:

1. Open the Start menu and search for "Computer Management."

2. Under "Local Users and Groups," click on "Users."

3. Right-click on "Guest" and select "Properties."

4. Uncheck the box that reads "Account is disabled."

5. Click "OK" to save the changes.

Once the guest account is enabled, guests can log in with a temporary account that restricts their access to certain features and folders. They will not be able to install software, make system changes, or access your personal files without your permission.

To switch to the guest account, simply log out of your current account and select "Guest" from the login screen. It's that easy!

The guest account trick is not only useful for protecting your privacy and security but also for sharing your computer with others. Whether you're hosting a party, having family over, or working on a group project, the guest account offers a hassle-free way to give others access to your computer.

In conclusion, the guest account trick is a hidden gem in Windows 10 that many users are missing out on. It's a simple and effective way to protect your privacy, enhance your security, and share your computer with guests. So unleash the ultimate Windows 10 secret and try the guest account trick today!

Step 1. First of all, click on the Start menu and search “Command Prompt” right-click on it and select “Run as administrator”
Step 2. Now from there, you need to type in the following command. Here you need to enter net user Visitor /add /active:yes and press the Enter button.

Step 4. In the next step, you need to remove the new user account from the default user group and add the newly created account to the Guest user group. For that enter the following commands one by one.
net localgroup users Visitor /delete
net localgroup users Visitor /add
