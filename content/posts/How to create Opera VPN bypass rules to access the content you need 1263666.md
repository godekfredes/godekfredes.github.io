# Unlock Unlimited Access to Censored Content with These Opera VPN Bypass Rules!

If you're tired of hitting a brick wall every time you try to access censored online content, fear not - Opera VPN is here to help! With Opera VPN, you can access content that was previously blocked in your country or region due to censorship or geo-restrictions. However, some websites might still block your access or limit your experience when using Opera VPN. To bypass these issues, we have compiled several Opera VPN bypass rules to help you unlock unlimited access to censored content.

## Rule #1 - Switch Servers

The first rule of Opera VPN bypassing is to switch servers if you encounter any blockages. Some websites might block access to their content if they detect that you are using a VPN. In such cases, it is recommended that you switch servers and try again. Opera VPN offers multiple server locations, and you can manually select the server that's closest to your physical location or one that is located in a country where your desired content is available. This will likely improve your chances of accessing the content that was previously restricted.

## Rule #2 - Disable Ad Blockers

Ad-blockers might help in blocking unwanted ads and pop-ups, but some websites use them to detect whether users are using a VPN. If the website detects that you're using an ad-blocker, it might restrict your access. In this case, you can try disabling the ad-blocker, and then try accessing the website again through Opera VPN.

## Rule #3 - Disable WebRTC

WebRTC is a communication protocol used by many websites to improve real-time communication features. However, it also poses a privacy risk, as it might reveal your real IP address, even when using a VPN. To disable WebRTC, open Opera's settings page, navigate to the "Privacy & security" section, and toggle off the "Use a prediction service to load pages more quickly" option. This action will disable WebRTC and prevent any site from detecting your real IP.

## Rule #4 - Try a Different Browser

Lastly, some websites might detect that you're using Opera VPN and restrict access even after trying the above methods. In such cases, you can try using a different browser. While Opera VPN is a great tool for bypassing censorship and geo-restrictions, it might not be the right fit for every website or situation. Try using a different browser like Firefox or Chrome, and see if you can access the restricted content.

In conclusion, Opera VPN is a great tool for bypassing censorship and accessing restricted content. However, some websites might block your access even when using a VPN. By following these Opera VPN bypass rules, you can improve your chances of accessing restricted content and unlock unlimited access to the online world.

Instead of being a way of accessing company assets, the VPN is now a method of browsing with a level of privacy you cannot get otherwise. What a VPN does is mask your identity and encrypt your internet traffic. Essentially, a VPN makes it far more difficult for bad actors to access the data you transmit or discover where that traffic is coming from. 
Enable a VPN and your browser will appear to come from a different region or country. This works by hiding your IP address and then redirecting everything through a specifically configured remote host, effectively making the remote server the source of your traffic.

Another benefit is that some VPNs can make regionally specific web content available to you. For example, there might be something in one country that's not available to the region where you live. Enable the VPN and select the proper country, and you should have access to that content. (Opera's VPN doesn't have this feature.)
The one caveat to using a VPN is that you'll probably notice that websites tend to load more slowly. That's usually a worthwhile trade-off, especially if privacy and security are your biggest concerns (which they should be). 
The Opera web browser includes its own no-log VPN built right into the browser. There's no need to download or install any additional applications or services and no need to subscribe to a paid plan. The Opera VPN is free and just works out of the box. So, anyone looking to up their security game within their web browser would do well to make use of the feature.
Also: How and why to use the Opera browser VPN
The problem some people run into when using a VPN with a web browser is that some sites refuse to work properly. When that happens, what do you do? If you're using the Opera browser, you can easily create bypass rules so those sites always work as expected.
Let me show you how.

 
## Requirements


The only thing you'll need is an updated version of the Opera web browser. I'll demonstrate with version 93.0.4585.37, running on Pop!_OS Linux but the operating system you use doesn't matter. You can use the Opera VPN on the desktop or mobile versions of the browser. 

 
## Enabling the OperaVPN


One thing to remember is that unless you set Opera to always enable the VPN at start, you'll have to manually enable it every time the same way you did above. Other than that, you now have a functioning VPN in the Opera web browser and have created the necessary bypass rules to ensure the content you need can be served up as expected.
Also: You're definitely not making the most of your password manager
Also: The fastest VPNs offer security with more speed
Remember, you will find the speed at which websites load will be slightly reduced. If that's a problem for you, you will have to either disable the VPN or add bypass rules for the sites that are the slowest. Another thing to consider is that Opera's VPN does not allow you to select the country to be used for the VPN. That means you can't use it to view region-specific content. But for anyone looking to add an extra layer of privacy and security to the web browser, this is a great way to go.
