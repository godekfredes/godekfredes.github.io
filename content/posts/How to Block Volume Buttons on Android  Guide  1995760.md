# Unlock the Secret to Better Sound Quality: Hack Your Android Phone's Volume Buttons Today!

If you are an audiophile, then sound quality is of utmost importance to you. You may have spent a fortune on buying high-quality headphones or portable speakers, but what if I told you that you could improve your Android phone's sound quality without spending a single penny?

Yes, that's right. The secret to better sound quality lies in hacking your Android phone's volume buttons. In this article, we will explore how you can unlock the potential of your Android phone's volume buttons to enhance your listening experience.

## Step 1: Install Your Preferred Audio App

Before we delve into the volume button hacks, you must install an audio app that supports equalizers. There are various audio apps available in the market such as Poweramp, Neutron Player, or Equalizer FX, to name a few. These apps allow you to adjust the sound settings according to your preference.

## Step 2: Enable Developer Options

The next step is to enable developer options on your Android phone. This step may vary for different Android phone models, but you can generally activate developer options by going to your phone's 'Settings' and then tapping on the 'About phone' option. You will see a 'Build number' option, and you need to tap on it seven times to enable developer options.

## Step 3: Customize Volume Buttons

Now that you have enabled developer options, you need to customize your phone's volume buttons. To do so, follow these steps:

- Go to 'Settings' and tap on 'System.'
- Under the 'System' settings, tap on 'Developer options.'
- Scroll down and find the 'Media' section.
- Here, you will see three options: 'Volume key long press,' 'Volume key music control,' and 'Volume key shortcut.'
- To enhance your listening experience, enable 'Volume key music control' and 'Volume key shortcut' options.

Note: The 'Volume key long press' option allows you to switch between vibrate, ring, and silent modes quickly.

## Step 4: Set Up Volume Button Controls for Your Audio App

The last step is to set your preferred audio app as the default music player for your phone. After doing so, you need to customize the volume button settings for that app. To do so, follow these steps:

- Open your audio app and go to its settings.
- Look for the 'Volume control' or 'Media' section in the app settings.
- Enable the option to 'Use volume keys for media.'
- Customize the volume button settings according to your preference.

Note: Different audio apps may have different settings for volume buttons. So, explore your app's settings to get the most out of it.

That's it! You have successfully hacked your Android phone's volume buttons, and now you can enjoy a better listening experience. You can customize your equalizer settings, increase the bass or treble, or adjust the sound according to the genre of music you are listening to.

In conclusion, hacking your Android phone's volume buttons is an easy and efficient way to enhance your listening experience without spending any money. So, go ahead and try these hacks on your Android phone and enjoy a better quality of music today!

In Summary


Volume buttons are sensitive and can easily be pressed accidentally, which can be very annoying, especially if you miss a call or accidentally turn off your alarm clock in the morning. If you’ve ever found yourself in this situation, you know how frustrating it can be.
Fortunately, there are a few ways you can block volume buttons on Android.
In this article, we’ll also show you how to achieve this with the Button Remapper and Volume Lock app.







Whether it is in your pocket or just sitting on a table, it is easy to turn the volume up without meaning to. This can be especially frustrating if you are in a quiet environment and suddenly your phone starts blasting music. Blocking the volume keys can prevent accidental changes to the volume levels and save you from a lot of frustration.
In this post, you’ll learn how to disable volume buttons on Android devices, remap the buttons, lock the volume settings, and why volume buttons change on their own. We also provide a solution for those who want to control the volume without the buttons. Read on to learn more!

 
## How To Disable Volume Buttons on Android?


It’s clear that the physical buttons for volume on your Android phone are intrusive and can be quite annoying. There are several ways to block volume buttons on Android, but we will discuss the three most effective methods.

 
### 1. Lock Volume Buttons by Switching Volume Buttons to Media Only


The easiest way to block volume keys on Android is to make media volume the only option. You won’t then be able to accidentally change the ring or notification volume, as this will disable the ring and notification volume. The only issue here’s to change the way the volume buttons work so that they’re only used to change the media volume.

To do this, go to Settings > Sounds and vibrations > Volume.
Then, select Media only.
Toggle the “Use the Volume keys for media” option to ON. From this moment on, every time you press the physical volume buttons on your phone, the multimedia volume changes, not the ringer volume.

 
### 2. Block Volume Buttons Using a Button Remapping App



This method allows you to disable or reassign hardware buttons on your device. You can use applications like Buttons Remapper or Button Mapper.
With these apps, you can assign the physical volume buttons to any action or disable them altogether. This way, you can prevent accidental button presses. Also, you can make your device more user-friendly by assigning the buttons to other actions.
For example, you can map the volume buttons to control the screen brightness or to take screenshots.

 
#### How to use Buttons Remapper
 

First, install the app from the Play Store using the link given above.
Open the app and grant it the necessary permissions. To do this, simply toggle on the “Services Enabled” checkbox.
Now tap the “+” button in the lower-right corner and select “Short and long press”.
Now, a screen like the one shown in the picture above will appear.
Select the Volume + button.
Now select Do Nothing from the Action drop-down list.
Repeat the process for the Volume “-” button.
Now, you have successfully disabled your volume keys.



You can also remap your volume keys for other actions like controlling the screen brightness or taking screenshots.
To do so, select the “Volume key +” button and then the desired action from the Action drop-down list.
And that’s it! You have now successfully reassigned your volume keys.

If you ever want to enable the volume buttons again, simply go to the Buttons Remapper app, long press the action you want to delete, and tap on the “Delete” button as shown above!

 
### 3. Lock Volume Buttons Using Volume Lock App



The Volume Lock app lets you lock the volume buttons so they can’t be accidentally changed. This is a great way to prevent accidental button presses.

 

To use this app, simply install it from the Play Store.
Once installed, open the app and set your desired volume.
Now, tap the “Locked” button.



And that’s it! Your volume buttons are now locked.

 

Go to Settings > Display > Advanced
Turn off the "Screen timeout" option.

 

Go to Settings > Accessibility and
Turn ON the "Vibrate on button press" option.



This is available on most Android phones by default.
This will ensure the volume buttons only control media volume and not others like ringtone volume or alarm volume.

 

First, try rebooting your phone if you are experiencing volume issues.
Second, ensure that you have the latest firmware for your device and Android operating system - this might help fix software-based problems.
Another potential cause of unwanted volume changes could be headphones that aren't compatible with your phone.

 

First, take a look at your device's volume settings. Sometimes, Android phones will set the volume too low when they detect a hardware issue with the speaker system.
Next, you'll want to check if the volume button is disabled. The volume button can automatically be disabled when you use it too loudly.



If you have an app that is causing the problem, you can try uninstalling recently installed/updated apps one by one and see if that fixes the issue. If you have a hardware issue, you may need to take your phone to a repair shop to get it fixed.
