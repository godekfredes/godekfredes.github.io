If you are excited about the new Windows 11 release, you are not alone. As the buzz around the new operating system continues to grow, more and more features are being uncovered, and insiders are getting access to exclusive features that are not yet available to the public. One way to unlock some of these insider features is by changing the Windows 11 channel, and in this article, we will show you how.

What are Windows 11 Channels?

Before we get into how to change your Windows 11 channel, let's first explore what a channel is. A Windows 11 channel is a set of updates and features that are released to a specific group of users. There are three main channels: Dev Channel, Beta Channel, and Release Channel. The Dev Channel provides early access to Windows 11 features that are still under development. The Beta Channel is for users who want to try out new features before they are widely available, while the Release Channel is for users who want a stable and reliable version of Windows 11.

How to Change Your Windows 11 Channel to Unlock Insider Features

To unlock insider features on Windows 11, you need to change your channel to the Dev Channel. Here are the steps to follow:

Step 1: Open the Settings app. You can do this by clicking on the Start menu and selecting Settings or by pressing the Windows key + I on your keyboard.

Step 2: Click on the Windows Update tab on the left-hand side of the Settings app.

Step 3: Click on the Advanced Options link.

Step 4: In the Choose Your Insider Preview Channel section, click the drop-down menu and select Dev Channel.

Step 5: Click Confirm in the pop-up window that appears.

Step 6: Wait for the updates to download and install. This may take some time, depending on your internet connection speed and the size of the update.

Step 7: Restart your computer when prompted.

Once your computer has restarted, you should have access to insider features that are not yet available to the public. Please note that the insider features may be unstable and could cause issues on your computer, so proceed with caution.

### Difference Between Insider Channels


During the launch of Windows 10, Microsoft launched Windows Insider Program. Right now, Microsoft rolls out the Windows updates in three separate channels. The channels include Dev Channel, Beta Channel, and Release Preview Channel.
Here’s what Microsoft says about each channel in Windows Insider Program:
Dev Channel: Ideal for highly technical users. Be the first to access the latest Windows 11 builds earliest in the development cycle with the newest code. There will be some rough edges and low stability.
Beta Channel: Ideal for early adopters. These Windows 11 builds will be more reliable than builds from our Dev Channel, with updates validated by Microsoft. Your feedback has the greatest impact here.
Release Preview Channel: Ideal if you want to preview fixes and certain key features, plus get optional access to the next version of Windows 10 before it’s generally available to the World. This channel is also recommended for commercial use.
The latest build of Windows 11 allows you to switch from Dev to Beta channel or vice versa. Microsoft hasn’t launched any Windows 11 build to the Release Preview Channel as of now.
