# Unlock ANY Applock Screen Instantly - No Password Required!

We all protect our smartphones with passwords, patterns, or fingerprint locks. We do this to prevent others from gaining access to our sensitive information and personal data. However, sometimes we forget our passwords, or our friends or family members accidentally change them. This can be frustrating, especially when we urgently need to access our phones.

Thankfully, there is a simple hack that allows you to unlock any applock screen instantly, without needing a password. This method works on both android and iOS devices and is easy to follow.

## Step 1: Open the Emergency Call Screen

The first step is to open the Emergency Call Screen on your phone. To do this, click on the 'Emergency dial' button on your lock screen.

## Step 2: Enter a Long Sequence of Characters

On the emergency call screen, you need to enter a long sequence of characters. This can be any sequence of characters, numbers, letters, and symbols, but it needs to be long enough to fill up the character limit present on the screen.

For instance, if the character limit is 10, you can enter a sequence such as "1234567890" or "qwertyuiop." Be creative and make sure that the sequence is long enough.

## Step 3: Copy and Paste the Sequence Several Times

After entering the sequence, copy and paste it several times until the characters fill up the entire screen. This is important because it overloads the applock screen, causing it to crash, and unlocking the phone.

## Step 4: Click on the Home Button

Once you have filled up the screen with the sequence, click on the home button. This will take you to your phone's home screen, and the applock screen will no longer be present.

## Step 5: Access Your Apps

You can now access all the apps on your phone, including your applock app, without needing a password. However, keep in mind that this hack only works until your next phone restart. After a restart, you need to repeat the entire process again.

## Conclusion

This hack is useful in situations where you have forgotten your applock password or when you urgently need to access your phone. However, use this hack responsibly, and do not try to access someone else's phone without their permission. Remember always to secure your phone with strong passwords, patterns, and fingerprints to prevent unauthorized access.
