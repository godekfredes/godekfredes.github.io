# Are You Guilty of Ignoring This Important Browser Maintenance Task? Learn How to Clear Your Opera Cache Now!

When was the last time you cleared your Opera cache? If you can't remember, you are not alone. Most people don't even know what a cache is or how it affects their browsing experience. In this article, we will discuss what a cache is, why it is important to clear it regularly, and how you can do it in Opera.

## What is a cache?

A cache is a temporary storage area. In the case of your web browser, it is where the browser stores copies of web pages, images, and other files that it has already downloaded. The purpose of the cache is to speed up your browsing experience by reducing the amount of data that needs to be downloaded when you visit a website again. Instead of downloading everything each time, your browser only needs to download new or updated parts of the page.

## Why is it important to clear your cache?

While a cache can speed up your browsing experience, it can also cause problems if it is not cleared regularly. Over time, your cache can become bloated with copies of files that are no longer needed or may even be outdated. This can lead to slow browsing speeds, pages that don't load properly, and even security issues.

Clearing your cache can help to:

- Speed up your browsing experience
- Resolve issues with pages not loading correctly
- Ensure that you have access to the latest version of a website
- Maintain your privacy by removing sensitive information stored in the cache

## How to clear your Opera cache

Clearing your Opera cache is a simple process. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the Opera browser and click on the menu icon (three horizontal lines) in the top-left corner.

2. Select "Settings" from the menu.

3. In the Settings page, click on "Privacy & security" in the left-hand menu.

4. Scroll down to the "Clear browsing data" section and click on "Choose what to clear."

5. Select the "Cached images and files" option.

6. Choose the time range for which you want to clear the cache. If you want to clear everything, select "All time."

7. Click on the "Clear data" button to clear your Opera cache.

Congratulations! You have successfully cleared your Opera cache. You should notice an immediate improvement in your browsing experience, with pages loading faster and displaying correctly.

## Conclusion

Clearing your Opera cache is an important maintenance task that should not be ignored. Without regular clearing of your cache, you may experience slower browsing speeds, pages that don't load correctly, and even security issues. By following the simple steps we've outlined in this article, you can easily clear your Opera cache and maintain a fast and secure browsing experience.

But like any browser, Opera can, over time, develop problems. Most often those problems lie within what's saved in the cache.
What is this "cache" I speak of? Simply put, it's saved files and information that the browser collects over time to simplify site rendering and make it easier for you to go back to the sites you've previously visited. 
However, that cache can cause problems. Some of those problems can be of the security type, while others simply slow the browser down. Recently, I experienced a significant slowdown with Opera because I'd forgotten to do the one thing I regularly do -- clear the cache. 
Let me explain the logic behind this.

As you browse the internet, your browser stores information, such as images and other data, in a cache. The more you browse, the more of that information is stored. The more that's stored, the harder the browser has to work, which can lead to slowdowns and even the inability to function properly. On top of that, over time you can wind up with a considerable store of information that takes up space on your drive. I've cleared browser caches that were gigabytes in size. 
For example, I cleaned my Opera browser cache three days ago. After using a tool called BleachBit, I discovered that Opera had already accumulated 1.22GB in the cache alone. Although that might not sound like much, once a cache gets that large, it can cause problems.
Before I cleaned the Opera cache this week, the size had grown to over 2GB and the browser struggled to work well. Even closing the browser was a task that threatened to lock up my desktop. Fortunately, clearing the cache solved the problem immediately.
And that, my friends, is just one of the reasons why you should clear your cache. If you need another reason, your web browser also saves cookies, which can include trackers (here's how to check for trackers in Apple's Safari browser). You don't want those hanging around, as they can lead to privacy and security issues. Because of that, you should get into the habit of regularly cleaning your Opera history.

 
## How to clear the Opera browser cache and why you should do it regularly


Fortunately, Opera makes this very easy. Let me show you how.

 
## Requirements


The only thing you'll need is the Opera browser installed on your desktop or laptop. I'll be demonstrating with version 93.0.4585.37 running on Pop!_OS, but the process is the same regardless of which operating system you use.
Let's clear that cache.

I ran a test to make sure the process works. After using the built-in cache cleaner, I ran BleachBit again and found the cache had decreased to 801.8MB. Although that's not zero, it's better than 1.22GB. Of course, I had a ton of tabs open at the time, some of which were auto-refreshing, so Opera was instantly storing data in the cache, even after it was cleared.

However, after I cleared the cache, Opera behaved much better.
I highly recommend that you get in the habit of regularly clearing the Opera cache, even if only to keep it running well. As far as clearing cookies and other information, that will depend on how you use the browser. 
If you prefer to have Opera retain your login information (which isn't always the best idea, as it can cause security problems), clearing cookies and other site data will log you out of your sites and require you to log back into them. If that's something you want to avoid, then only clear cached images and files.
If you're looking to get even more security from your browser, I would suggest clearing both cached images and files, as well as cookies and other site data.
