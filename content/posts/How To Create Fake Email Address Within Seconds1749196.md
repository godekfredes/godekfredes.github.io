Step 2: Create a Random Email Address
Once you've chosen a temporary email provider, create an account by selecting an anonymous username (nickname). Your email address should be crafted to look as generic as possible to evade suspicion. If our name is John Doe, you can try something like johndoemail@temporarymail.com.

Step 3: Avoid Linking
Make sure to log out from any accounts you access through your temporary email address, so your activities can't be traced back to you. Moreover, avoid linking your temporary email address to any personal accounts or services.

Conclusion:
