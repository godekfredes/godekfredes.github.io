# Stop Annoying Whatsapp Messages for Good: The Ultimate Guide to Blocking and Reporting Spam!

Are you tired of receiving spam messages on WhatsApp? Have you ever wondered how to stop annoying WhatsApp messages for good? You're in the right place! Here's the ultimate guide to blocking and reporting spam on WhatsApp.

## Reasons to Block and Report Spam on WhatsApp 

Spam messages on WhatsApp can be frustrating, and may even lead to scams or phishing attacks. These messages often contain malicious links or requests for personal information. Blocking and reporting spam on WhatsApp can help you protect yourself and others from potentially harmful messages.

## How to Block and Report Spam on WhatsApp

To block a contact on WhatsApp, follow these steps:

1. Open WhatsApp and locate the contact you wish to block.
2. Tap on the three dots at the top-right corner of the screen.
3. Select "More" from the options.
4. Tap on "Block".
5. Confirm your decision by selecting "Block".

Once you block a contact, they won't be able to send you messages, calls, or see your profile picture or status. This will also prevent them from seeing your updates and stories.

If you receive spam or unwanted messages from a number that isn't saved in your contacts, follow these steps to report it:

1. Open the conversation with the spam message.
2. Tap and hold the message.
3. Select "Report".
4. Confirm your decision by selecting "Report".

WhatsApp will review the report and take appropriate action, which may include blocking the number or removing the account.

## Additional Tips to Avoid Spam on WhatsApp

Apart from blocking and reporting spam, there are other ways to avoid unwanted messages on WhatsApp:

1. Never open links from unknown sources. These could lead to phishing websites, scams or viruses.
2. Do not share personal information with anyone you don't know, including on WhatsApp.
3. Turn off automatic downloads for media items in WhatsApp settings. This can help you avoid potential viruses or malware.
4. Enable two-step verification. This will help secure your account and prevent unauthorized access.

## Conclusion

Blocking and reporting spam on WhatsApp can help you avoid frustrating and potentially dangerous messages. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can protect yourself and others from unwanted messages. Remember, always be careful what you share and who you communicate with on WhatsApp. Stay safe and stay informed!

Because of this, it's become crucial for you to not only avoid such messages but also to report the senders and block their addresses. By reporting those senders, you very well might prevent others from receiving that same spam. 
Sadly enough, nearly every messaging service is vulnerable to spam, including Whatsapp. If you use this app, you need to start blocking and reporting those bad actors.
Let me show you how.

 
## Requirements


The only thing you'll need for this is the Whatsapp installed (on either Android or iOS) and a message you suspect to be spam.

 
## Block and report a message 


Before I show you how to do this, you must never click on a link sent to you by a suspicious sender. Ever. Period. If you don't know the sender, assume it's spam and avoid tapping links at any/all costs.

 
### 1. Open the suspect message


With that said, locate and tap the message in question. 

 
### 2. Access the sender's details


Once you've opened the message, tap the contact name or number at the top of the screen (Figure 1).

 
### 3. Block and report the sender


At the bottom of the sender details page (Figure 2), tap Block and then tap Report.

 
## How to unblock a contact


Let's say, for example, you accidentally block a user, only to later find out they were legitimate. How do you unblock them? Simple. Here's how:

 
Open Whatsapp.Tap the three-dot menu button and tap Settings.Tap Account > Privacy.Scroll down to the bottom and tap Blocked contacts.Tap the sender to unblock and (when prompted) tap Unblock NUMBER (Where NUMBER is the number associated with the contact - Figure 3).


And that's all there is to blocking and reporting spam on Whatsapp. Remember, keeping diligent about not tapping on links or replying to messages from unknown contacts is an absolute must these days. Being careless with SMS and other types of incoming messages can land you in a world of trouble, by way of ransomware and other types of attacks. And given how much sensitive data we keep on our mobile devices these days, that extra amount of caution will go a long way to protect you from such attacks.
