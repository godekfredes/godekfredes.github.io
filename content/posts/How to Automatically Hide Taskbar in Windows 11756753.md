Say Goodbye To Annoying Taskbar Clutter In Windows 11: Learn The Magic Trick To Automatic Hiding Now!

If you are a Windows 11 user, you are probably well familiar with the Taskbar. Taskbar is the thin horizontal bar at the bottom of your screen that runs the breadth of the screen width, and it houses the Start menu button, pinned shortcuts for apps, and other icons for running applications.

While many people find the Taskbar very useful for accessing their favorite apps and programs quickly, it can also be annoying to have it clutter your screen space, particularly if you are working on something that requires your full attention.

The good news is that Windows 11 offers an excellent trick to take care of this problem: Automatic Hiding. With this trick, the Taskbar will only appear when you need it, and it will disappear from sight when you don't.

Here's how you can implement the magic trick:

Step 1: Right-click on any blank space on the Taskbar.

Step 2: Select the option that is marked "Taskbar settings."

Step 3: Under the Taskbar settings, toggle the switch that is marked "Automatically hide the taskbar in desktop mode" to the right to turn it on.

Step 4: Once you have turned on this setting, your Taskbar will disappear from sight when you are not using it, and it will reappear when you move your mouse over the part of the screen where the Taskbar should be.

And voila! That's all there is to it! You have now learned the magic trick to automatically hiding your Taskbar in Windows 11, and freeing up valuable screen real estate.

Of course, there may be times when you need your Taskbar fixed into position even when you're not actively using it. For example, you may want to keep your Taskbar visible because you have a calendar feature, a clock, or other important widgets placed there.

If that's the case, all you need to do is toggle off the "Automatic hiding" feature, and your Taskbar will always be visible, no matter what you are working on.

In conclusion, the Taskbar is a very useful feature on Windows 11, but it can clutter your screen and become an annoyance. With the magic trick of Automatic hiding, you can keep your Taskbar where you need it, when you need it, and have more screen space to spend on the things that matter.
