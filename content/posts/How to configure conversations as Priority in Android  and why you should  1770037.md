# Revolutionize Your Communication Game: Learn How to Set Conversations as Priority and Never Miss an Important Message Again!

Effective communication is essential for personal and professional growth. Today, the world is more connected than ever before, thanks to technology. However, with the bombardment of information and distractions clamoring for our attention, it's easy to miss out on important messages, leading to misunderstandings and lost opportunities. In this article, we will explore the art of setting conversations as a priority, ensuring you never miss an important message again.

## The Importance of Communication

Communication is central to our wellbeing and relationships. It enables us to share our thoughts, feelings, and ideas with others, forge connections, and build trust. In the professional sphere, communication forms the foundation of successful teamwork, innovation, and productivity. Poor communication, on the other hand, can lead to confusion, conflict, and failure to achieve goals.

## The Challenges of Modern Communication

Despite the abundance of communication tools available today, including email, instant messaging, and social media, communication challenges still exist. These challenges include:

* Overload of information
* Distraction
* Misunderstanding
* Lack of a personal touch
* Inability to convey tone and emotion

To overcome these obstacles, it is essential to prioritize conversations and use tools effectively.

## Setting Conversations as a Priority

Setting conversations as a priority means ensuring that communication, particularly important messages, are not lost or delayed. Here are some tips for prioritizing conversations:

### Set Aside Time for Communication

One of the most effective ways to prioritize communication is to set aside time for it. This could be in the form of a daily check-in with colleagues, a weekly team meeting, or a bi-monthly update with clients. Scheduling communication ensures that messages are not missed or neglected and allows for clear and concise conversation.

### Use the Right Communication Tool

Different communication tools suit different situations. Email is great for sharing detailed information or documentation, while instant messaging is best for quick questions or updates. Phone calls and video meetings provide a personal touch and enable real-time conversation. Choose the communication tool that suits the situation to ensure clear and efficient communication.

### Practice Active Listening

Active listening means giving full attention to the speaker and responding appropriately. It means focusing on what the speaker is saying rather than preparing a response. Active listening facilitates understanding, reduces misunderstandings, and builds trust between parties.

### Clarify, Clarify, Clarify

Misunderstandings can be costly in terms of time, money, and resources. Clarifying information by asking questions, summarizing, or rephrasing ensures that both parties have a clear understanding of the message. This reduces the likelihood of misunderstandings and ensures that important messages are received and acted upon.

### Create a Culture of Communication

Creating a culture of communication means encouraging open and honest dialogue at all levels of an organization. It means recognizing the importance of communication in achieving goals and empowering everyone to communicate effectively. A culture of communication ensures that everyone is heard, ideas are shared, and relationships are strengthened.

## Conclusion

Effective communication is essential for success in our personal and professional lives. By prioritizing conversations, using the right communication tools, practicing active listening and clarifying messages, we can overcome the challenges of modern communication and never miss an important message again. Ultimately, creating a culture of communication ensures that our relationships and organizations thrive.

Fortunately, starting with Android 11, Google added a feature that helps make sure you don't miss out on those more important conversations. 
The feature in question is called Priority conversations. Once you've set a conversation as a priority, it will get its own section within the Notification Shade that makes it easier to catch them.

In some cases (such as with Facebook Messenger), those conversations will be placed in bubbles that appear and remain on your home screen until you delete them. 
By making use of Priority conversations, I haven't missed a single important missive since. 
Before you dive into this, think carefully about what conversations you want to add as a Priority. If you add too many conversations to the feature, you'll wind up inundated anyway and will probably miss out in the end. To that end, choose wisely.

 
## Requirements


As I mentioned, this feature arrived in Android 11, so you'll need a device running at least that version of the OS. You'll also need some conversations to add, which can be taken from the Android Messages app, Facebook Messenger, Slack, WhatsApp, and more. That's all you need. Let's make this a priority.

Priority conversations: Those conversations you've set as Priority.Non-priority conversations: Those conversations you've made changes to (such as moving them to Priority and out).Recent conversations: Recent conversations that have never been added to Priority.


At this point, those conversations you've added to the Priority list will now (at least) show up in the Priority section of the Notification Shade or as Bubbles on your home screen. This is a great way to ensure you don't miss out on anything from those contacts who should be considered a priority.
