Revolutionize Your Computer's Performance with These Expert Tips for Choosing the Ultimate SSD Solid State Drive!

Are you tired of waiting ages for your computer to boot up, load applications, and open files? Do you find yourself frequently running out of storage space because of your system's slow hard drive? If so, then it's time to upgrade your computer's storage to a solid-state drive (SSD). SSDs offer faster read and write speeds, lower power consumption, and enhanced durability compared to traditional HDDs. In this article, we'll share with you some expert tips on choosing the ultimate SSD to revolutionize your computer's performance.

1. Consider the Interface

The interface of an SSD determines how it connects to your computer's motherboard. The most popular interface is SATA III (Serial ATA III), which offers a maximum transfer speed of 6 Gbps. However, if you have a newer system, you may consider an NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) SSD, which can provide up to 32 Gbps of bandwidth. NVMe drives plug directly into a PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect express) slot and bypass SATA altogether. NVMe drives are more expensive than SATA SSDs, so consider your needs and budget when selecting an interface.

2. Look for a High Capacity

The higher the capacity of the SSD, the more space you have to store your data files, games, and applications. As a rule of thumb, try to select an SSD with a capacity that's at least double the size of your current hard drive. For example, if your existing HDD has 500 GB of storage, consider an SSD with at least a 1 TB capacity. However, if you're on a tight budget, you may opt for a smaller SSD that's still bigger than your current hard drive.

3. Check the Read and Write Speeds

One of the most significant advantages of SSDs is their fast read and write speeds. It's important to check these speeds when selecting an SSD. The higher the read and write speeds, the faster your computer will boot up, load programs, and open files. Fortunately, most SSD manufacturers provide these details online. Look for an SSD with a read speed of at least 500 MB/s and a write speed of at least 400 MB/s for optimal performance.

4. Check the Cache Size

SSDs have a built-in cache to accelerate the data transfer speed. The larger the cache, the better the performance of the SSD. Manufacturers advertise cache sizes in MB or GB. As a general rule, select an SSD with a cache size of at least 16 MB, but again, it depends on your needs and budget.

5. Check the Endurance and Warranty

Because SSDs use flash memory to store data, there's a limit to the number of write cycles they can undergo. Manufacturers usually advertise the endurance limit in Terabytes Write (TBW). The higher the TBW rating, the better the endurance and lifespan of the drive. Most SSDs come with a limited warranty period, which varies from manufacturer to manufacturer. Be sure to check the warranty period and terms before purchasing the SSD.

Conclusion

Upgrading your computer's storage to an SSD can significantly enhance its performance, but choosing the right SSD is critical. When selecting an SSD, consider the interface, capacity, read and write speeds, cache size, endurance, and warranty. By following these expert tips, you can revolutionize your computer's performance and enjoy faster boot times, quicker application launches, and more efficient data transfers.

After realizing the benefits of solid-state drives, most people rush into buying the first product available at a healthy discount, without taking in to consideration, some vital factors, such as the reading speed, the type of memory used and even the technology chosen for build. While an attractive price will surely raise some eyebrows, rest assured that it comes with downsides.


 
### How to choose an SSD?


There are a few things which must be taken in to consideration before purchasing a solid state drive. Here’s what we’ve gathered from our own experience and from thoughts spread online:

 

Maximum speed – every SSD comes with a maximum speed factor attached for reading and writing data, so be sure to check this parameter out. As its name claims, this is the maximum speed that the storage unit can achieve while reading, or writing information. Please note that the maximum speed may only be achieved while peeking and the actual speed of the drive is somewhat lower.
Flash technology used – most people know that solid-state drives usually built using FLASH memories, which is correct. The lesser-known aspect is that two kinds of FLASH memories are used for SSDs, called multi-level cell (MLC) and single-level cell (SLC). The differences between these two concepts is that MLC can store information on several cells, making it a cheaper variant, but also one that comes with a higher rate of error. SLC on the other side has little file errors, meaning it offers faster real-time speeds, but has higher selling costs.
Error correction code – this technology has been introduced in MLC technology (explained above) to reduce the downsides of the cheaper cell concept. There are several advantages of this technology, but the most significant improvement is seen in the actual reading speed, where the performances of multi-level cell flash can reach levels comparable with SLC. Also, ECC also helps the detection of corrupted data and makes sure that everything on the SSD is usable.
Latest SATA Support – SATA is the interface between the computer and the solid-state drive and besides being composed out of a cable and some fancy connectors, it is also defined by a speed protocol. For instance, the first SATA standard allowed speed transfers up to 1.5 Gbps and every new SATA standard has doubled the speed. To avoid creating bottlenecks, users must make sure that the SSD bought comes with the latest SATA support or the data will gather near the wire, just like a crowd of people when traversing a narrow bridge. This principle is also viable for the computer itself.

 
#### Maximum Speeds are the Bandwidth of SSDs



Purchasing a solid-state drive is not a stroll in the park, mainly because these items are really expensive. Just like purchasing a car, avoid being tricked by the flashy numbers of the maximum speeds and other stuff like that by searching comprehensive details about the future acquisition. For example, one must also search for the real-speed parameter. This is the actual speed that the SSD will usually run on and can only be witnessed after purchasing the gear.
After a general analysis you will see that the actual throughput scales around 66% of the maximum transfer speeds, this percentage being sometimes topped by the more expensive drives.

 
#### Physical Size also matters


We are talking about the actual size of the drive, and not about its capacity. This usually happens to laptop users, which impressed by the performances attached to a solid-state drive, they rush into purchasing the unit before analyzing if it’s small enough to fit.
There are no problems for desktop users, but when comparing laptop HDDs with solid-state drives, the last category is usually twice as thick.

 
#### Sometimes, the company is worth paying for


I don’t usually like paying double the price of a product just for the sake of getting a reliable item, but when it comes to solid-state drives, this is not an option. Considering the fact that his is a rather new concept and that anyone wants a bite of the big pay, do not purchase gear from un-reliable companies.
Once again, look for names frequently bragged in reviews and for high-rating products on the vendor page (big companies can also make bad products sometimes). Here’s a small list with the most important names in the industry:

 

OCZ
Crucial
Kingston
Intel
Fusion-io
Violin

 
#### Watch out for tricks


Just like Steve Jobs did with the iPad, manufacturers usually hide information that makes them look bad and this has become a habit through major vendors as well. Before purchasing a brand new SSD that can eventually “spin” slower than a conventional HDD, make sure that all the information is out in the open.
This trick is usually performed not when selling the SSD as a separate part, but when “advanced” laptops are being branded as super-fast, just because they come with a solid drive. In most cases, the only parameter given is the capacity and there are no mentions about the maximum reading/writing speed, sometimes not even the name. The even bad part is that transparency cannot be enforced, in most cases a call / an email to the vendor will solve absolutely nothing.
So, better purchase from honest dealers – these are usually the small ones.

 
### Other SSD tips



Besides everything presented above, and even the comprehensive guide on how to optimize SSDs, there is still something important that needs to be done after purchasing a solid-state drive. To get things straight, this category of equipment requires a bit more information from the processor itself, unlike regular disk drives. To be more specific, SSDs will require the Windows to frequently send information about deleted data, and this feature is only supported in Windows 7, and probably in Windows 8.
Besides being absent from the classic Windows XP and even from Vista, the TRIM feature, as it is called, must be enabled at all times. In some configurations, usually new PCs, the manufacturer does not activate it. So, to check if TRIM is enabled or even activate it yourself, here are a couple of helpful commands, which can be run in the command prompt with administrative rights:
• fsutil behavior query DisableDeleteNotify – checks if TRIM is enabled, zero should be returned • fsutil behavior set DisableDeleteNotify 0 – activates TRIM (the last character is a zero)
