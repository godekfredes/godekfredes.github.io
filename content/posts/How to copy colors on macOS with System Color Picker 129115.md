Unleash Your Inner Design Genius: Master How to Easily Copy Colors on MacOS with This Simple Hack!

Are you tired of trying to match colors for your designs, only to end up with a totally different shade than what you intended? Do you struggle to replicate colors from one app to another on your MacOS device? Well, fret no more! With this simple hack, you can easily copy colors on MacOS like a pro.

Step 1: Locate the Digital Color Meter on your MacOS

The Digital Color Meter is a built-in tool on your MacOS device that allows you to sample colors from your screen. To locate it, simply go to your Applications folder and open the Utilities folder. There, you will find the Digital Color Meter app.

Step 2: Configure the Digital Color Meter to your preferred settings

Once you open the Digital Color Meter app, you will see a window with a "Test Target" option. Click on it and select "RGB as RGB sliders". This will allow you to see the RGB values of the color you will be copying.

Step 3: Sample the color you want to copy

Now that your Digital Color Meter is configured, it's time to sample the color you want to copy. Simply move the crosshair over the color you want to copy, and the app will display the RGB values of that color.

Step 4: Copy the RGB values

Once you have sampled the color, all you need to do is copy the RGB values. To do this, simply press "Command + C" on your keyboard, or go to "Edit" on the top menu and select "Copy".

Step 5: Paste the RGB values

Now, you can easily paste the RGB values into any design tool or software you are using. This will allow you to replicate the exact color you sampled, giving you the perfect shade you need for your design.

With this simple hack, you can easily master how to copy colors on MacOS, and unleash your inner design genius. No more struggling to match colors or wasting time trying to find the perfect shade. Follow these simple steps, and you'll be designing like a pro in no time!

That's what we're going to talk about here.

 
## Getting started with System Color Picker


Like all Mac App Store apps, installation is a breeze. Just point yourself at the app and press Get. I have mine installed, so it says Open instead.
When you first open System Color Picker, it presents a color picker window. We're going to ignore that and tweak a few settings first. Go up to the menu bar and select Preferences.Â 
You'll see this window: 
Obviously, you can choose whatever you want, but I found I like these settings because it keeps the color picker on top of all the other windows and is accessible from the menu bar. Since it's something I use all the time, I far prefer that over the dock icon. 
Now that System Color Picker is set up, it's time to pick some colors. All you need to do is choose Pick Color from under the droplet icon and then move your cursor over the color you want to pick up and click. 
As you select colors, they get added to the Recently Picked Colors menu, which retains the last six colors you picked. 
If you want to insert the color into your design, you have a bunch of options. These are all controlled by the Color tab of the System Color Picker Preferences tab.
As you can see, you can turn on and off a bunch of formatting options for how you want the code to be placed in your clipboard.
Because I do a lot of web development, I generally like capturing the hex code and formatting it without the hash mark. That's because I'm so used to typing # before my colors that I wind up with color codes like ##297fec in my code, which is not what I am looking for. Leaving out the hash mark also works well when specifying colors in Photoshop.

Finally, let's take a look at the selection window we saw when the app launched for the first time. You can bring this up anytime by selecting Toggle Window.
That gives you the full-featured color window common to most Mac design applications. 
And there you go. You can do color selection from the Finder on macOS, just like Lance showed us for Windows. 
Is this a tool you're likely to regularly use? It is for me. What other helpful little Mac utilities do you rely on? Let us know in the comments below.
