Are you tired of missing important messages and calls on your Samsung Galaxy S8 or S7 because your screen goes to sleep at night? Well, we have the solution for you! With this game-changing hack, you can keep your display on all night, ensuring that you never miss an important notification again.

Step 1: Developer Options

To use this hack, you'll need to enable the Developer Options on your Samsung Galaxy S8 or S7. To do this, go to your phone's Settings, then select About Phone. From here, scroll down until you see Build Number. Tap on this seven times until you see the message "You are now a developer!"

Step 2: Keep Screen On

Next, go back to your phone's Settings and select Developer Options. Scroll down until you see the option for "Stay Awake" or "Keep Screen On." Enable this option, and your phone's display will stay on as long as it's plugged in.

Step 3: Night Mode

While keeping your screen on all night may be helpful, it can also be distracting if you're trying to sleep. To counteract this, you can enable Night Mode on your Samsung Galaxy S8 or S7. This will dim your screen and make it easier on your eyes.

To enable Night Mode, go to your phone's Settings and select Display. From here, select the option for Night Mode and toggle it on.

Step 4: Use a Docking Station

To keep your phone charged and in the perfect position, consider using a docking station. This will not only keep your phone from moving around, but it will also help to prevent your charger cord from fraying.

With this simple hack, you'll never miss an important message or call on your Samsung Galaxy S8 or S7 again. Give it a try and let us know how it works for you!

The Always On Display functionality on the Galaxy S8 and S7 remains one of my favorite features of the device. Samsung had first debuted this feature with the Galaxy S7 in 2016 and has kept refining it since then.

While Samsung says that using Always On Display will only lead to an additional battery drain of less than 1% per hour that’s not the case. The impact is significantly bigger than that and on the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S8, having the feature enabled could lead to the phone requiring a top-up late in the afternoon to make it through the evening.
If like me, you have Always On Display disabled, there’s a handy new app that will automatically enable the feature when the phone is being charged. So, if you have a wireless charging dock for the Galaxy S7 or S8, you can pop the phone on it and be able to check for any unread notifications at a glance while working since Always On Display will be enabled.
The AOD On Charge app achieves this functionality through Tasker, so you need to have both apps installed on your handset. The AOD On Charge app itself offers so advanced settings or has a UI of itself. With the app installed, all you need to do is open it to toggle Always On Display while charging on or off. The app will simply show a toast message when it toggles AOD on/off. And if you want to change the Always On Display type, head over to Settings -> Lock Screen & Security -> Always On Display.
