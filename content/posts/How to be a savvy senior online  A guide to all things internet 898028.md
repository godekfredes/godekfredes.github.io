# You Won't Believe How Being A Savvy Senior Online Can Save You Thousands - Master The Internet With Our Ultimate Guide!

In today's digital age, there's no way to deny the importance of the internet in our lives. From keeping in touch with our loved ones, to shopping for groceries, the internet has become an indispensable tool for all aspects of our lives. As a senior citizen, taking advantage of the internet is not only essential, but it can also be cost-saving. In this article, we will show you how being a savvy senior online can save you thousands of dollars and help you master the internet with our ultimate guide.

## The Advantages of Shopping Online

Shopping online is a great way to save time, hassle, and money. You can find deals and discounts that might not be available in stores, and you don't have to physically go to stores, avoiding that agonizing wait in line. But, aside from the obvious, there are other benefits you might not have considered. For example, by buying in bulk or subscribing to Amazon's Subscribe & Save program, you can save even more money. You can also take advantage of rewards programs, which earn you cashback or points that can be redeemed for discounts.

## Finding the Best Deals

Another great advantage of the internet is the ability to find the best deals. Whether you're looking for a new car or a new toaster, there are websites and apps that can help you find the lowest price. For example, the website Honey and the app RetailMeNot both offer coupons for online stores, helping you save money on your purchase. Also, sites like Camelcamelcamel can help you track the price history of an item on Amazon, so you can figure out if you should wait for a sale or buy now.

## Banking and Finance

Managing your finances online can also save you a lot of money. For example, online banks and credit unions offer much higher interest rates on savings accounts than traditional banks. You can also use apps like Mint to track your expenses and budget effectively, and maybe even spot extra subscriptions you don't need anymore. There are also many online investment sites like Robinhood and Webull, helping you trade stocks without any commissions. And don't forget about coupons and discounts from your favourite stores you can access via mobile banking apps.

## Socializing Online

Socializing isn't all about savings, but it can be a great way to save on travelling expenses, too. Video conferencing apps like Skype and Zoom can keep you in touch with your family and friends without spending a dime on tickets or gasoline. Also, joining online communities and forums related to your hobbies or interests is a great way to socialize and meet new people.

## Staying Informed

Staying informed is a vital part of aging, and the internet can help you stay up-to-date on news, current events and other topics. With countless news apps available, such as NPR, Flipboard and News Republic, you can read the latest headlines from your phone or computer, saving time and money instead of buying print newspapers.

Mastering the Internet is More Important Than Ever

In conclusion, by mastering the internet, you can save money, time and enhance your relationships with others. As a senior, it's never too late to learn new skills and take advantage of new technologies. Whether you're looking to better manage your finances, find the best deals or want to stay informed about the world, there are countless resources and opportunities available online. It's time to take your senior lifestyle online and see how it can save you thousands!

That's where we come in. We're here to make life on the internet easier to understand, and to help you stay safe. We've created a guide explaining how to set up an internet connection, personalize your internet experience, and more importantly, feel safe while doing so.

 
## Finding Your Internet Provider


First and foremost, you'll need to set up an internet connection. It's no secret that internet plans can get expensive. And the process of figuring out which providers are both available and affordable can be a frustrating experience, especially if you've had your heart set on a certain provider. Unlike cell phone carriers where you're free to choose the company, most homes are only served by one or two set internet providers. As a result, you may not have access to the provider you want. Check out our review of the best internet providers to see what providers are available in your zip code.
Fortunately, most major cable and DSL providers offer senior discounts and programs that accommodate low-income households.

### Personalize Your Browsing Experience


Once your internet is set up, you can start customizing the features that create an experience that's right for you and your family. Among some of the most useful features are parental controls and font size. Parental controls act as a preventative tool, protecting you and your family from the darker ends of the internet.

 
### Parental controls


Most providers now have parental controls built-in to their routers making the installation process, while the technician is present, which is the best time to activate this feature. If you happen to miss this window, most providers give you the ability to activate this feature online in your internet account settings. If all else fails, we recommend reaching out to your provider for assistance.

 
### Adjusting font size


Font size serves as an aiding tool, giving you the ability to increase painstakingly small text. This is especially useful if you're planning on doing a lot of online reading and researching.
Shortcut functions: To increase font size, hold down Ctrl (for Windows) or Command (for Mac) and tap the Plus (+) key. If you're looking to decrease, hold down Ctrl or Command and tap the Minus (-) key. Otherwise, here's how to adjust font size in different browsers:

 
Chrome: In the upper corner of your screen, click on Chrome and you should see an option called Preferences. This will take you to Settings where you'll find Appearance. Under Appearance, you should see Font Size and Page Zoom.Safari: In the upper corner of your screen, click on Safari and you should see an option called Preferences. After you open Preferences, look for a tab called Advanced. Once you click on this, you should see an Accessibility option that allows you to adjust the default font size.Internet Explorer: In the upper corner of your screen, click Tools and select Internet Options. In this window, located at the bottom of the General tab, you should see Fonts. In this menu, you'll be able to adjust the default font size.


Other features we like include the ability to convert text to speech, increase color contrast, and reduce transparency.

 
### Speech tools


Text-to-speech tools are primarily intended for disabled users, but they're also a great feature if you have difficulty reading text, or if your eyes tire quickly from computer screens.

 
Mac users:Go to System Preferences and click on Accessibility. In this menu, you should see Speech. There should be an unchecked box next to "Speak selected text when the key is pressed." After you check this box, highlight any text and hold down Option + Esc.Windows users: Go to Settings and click on Ease of Access. In this menu, click Use Narrator.
 
### High contrast colors and transparency


Another way to improve your reading experience is through contrast and transparency settings. Some websites use low-contrast colors and various shades in text in an effort to make their page more appealing. The by-product is a minimalist design that ultimately makes for a more difficult read, sometimes even leading to eye strain. Adjusting these settings gives you the ability to experience a website in a way that's most readable for you.
Shortcut functions: For Mac users, hold down Control + Option + Command + Period (.) to increase contrast. For Windows users, hold down left Alt + left Shift + Print Screen to turn high contrast on or off.

 
Mac users: Go to System Preferences and click on Accessibility. In this menu, you should see Display. There should be unchecked boxes next to "Increase contrast" and "Reduce transparency," as well as a slider to manually adjust "Display contrast."Windows users: Go to Settings and click on Ease of Access. In this menu, click High contrast. To reduce transparency, go to Settings and click on Personalization. Select Colors from the sidebar. Scroll down and you should see "Transparency effects" under More options.
 
## Ways to Keep Yourself Safe Online


Whether you're banking online, shopping, or scrolling through social media feeds, everything you do online comes with some level of risk. While it may be impossible to fully eliminate online threats, there are plenty of ways to reduce them. The first thing we recommend is downloading antivirus software. This software will act as your first line of defense by detecting and removing viruses, and other unsolicited malware. This type of protection can be costly as most premium programs range between $20-$100, but it's absolutely worth it for the safety of your computer. Beyond antivirus software, all you can do is practice safe internet habits:

 
Create unique passwordsYour passwords should be at least eight characters and should include symbols and numbersWe also recommend writing your passwords down in a designated notebook.Use social media privacy settingsMany seniors use social media as a means to connect with family members and friends. While social media is great for these reasons, there are plenty of privacy concerns. Fortunately, most sites, like Facebook, have extensive settings that allow you to restrict who can see your posts, photos, and personal information.Only shop on secure websitesIf you're unsure, look at your address bar at the top. Most secure sites have a lock symbol by the website name.Avoid giving out sensitive informationNever give out your SSN online unless you're absolutely certain it's a secure website requiring it for legitimate reasons, such as online banking or signing up for a new TV service that requires your social for a credit check.


Lastly, we want to place an emphasis on identifying malicious emails and social media scams as seniors are notoriously targeted. One of the trickiest scams to spot are emails that imitate legitimate companies. If you receive a suspicious email that appears to be from a real company, make sure you look at the sender's email address. More often than not, you'll find the address is either unrelated to the company it's posing as, or features an unusual array of numbers, characters, or symbols around the company name. These features indicate the email is fake. Of course, this isn't the only way unsolicited emails attempt to fool you.
Cybersecurity expert Shannon Wilkinson provides further context:
"Seniors have faced targeted scams on social media as well with fraudsters posing as grandchildren asking for financial assistance due to accidents or tragedies. The scammers will say that they were traveling, cannot be contacted on the phone, and a slew of other things to give the request an appearance of extreme urgency."
If you receive an email or message that raises even the slightest alarm, it's always best practice to delete or simply ignore it. If you're unsure, a good rule of thumb is if something seems too good — or bad — to be true, it almost always is.

Your device won't connect to the internetYour internet connection may not be the problem at all — it could be your device. This may seem obvious, but make sure your issue is happening across all your devices. If you find that it's only happening on your phone, your problem lies with that one device. If that's the case, you should try restarting that device.If you've confirmed it's not your device, rebooting your router should always be your next move. Simply unplug your router, wait about thirty seconds, then plug it back in.Your router and device indicate that you're connected, but your internet isn't workingMake sure your device is connected to your personal network. Sometimes devices will automatically connect to a public network, especially if you've connected to one before.Restart or try a different internet browser (e.g. Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari). Oftentimes, there's a cache or network problem that you can fix just by closing out of all internet windows.If none of these solutions work, try restarting your device(s).A local outageIf you think your area may be affected, ask a neighbor. If they're also experiencing the issue, it's time to reach out to your service provider. Don't be afraid to ask for a credit on your next bill if this is the case.
