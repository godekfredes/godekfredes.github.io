WARNING: Check this BEFORE adding any song to your Spotify playlists - How to quickly determine if a track is copyrighted or not!

Spotify is one of the most popular music streaming services available today, with millions of tracks available to users. While it's tempting to add any song you like to your playlists, it's important to determine if a track is copyrighted or not, to avoid any legal issues.

Here's how to quickly determine if a track is copyrighted or not:

Step 1 - Check the Copyright Status:
Before adding a song to your playlist, make sure the track is not copyrighted, to avoid any legal issues. Copyright protection is a legal right granted to creators of original work, which includes music pieces. To check if a track is copyrighted, you can use the database of the United States Copyright Office or international equivalents.

Step 2 - Check With the Creator or Publisher
If you're not sure of the copyright status of a song, it's best to check with the creator or publisher before adding it to your playlist. If the creator has music available on Spotify, you can easily find their contact information through their artist page or social media accounts. You could also look up the song's album or music label and contact them directly.

Step 3 - Use Spotify's Check Copyright System
Another way to determine if a track is copyrighted or not is to use Spotify's built-in check system. Under the 'Spotify for Artists' program, creators can upload their music to the platform and check if their songs are available on other users’ playlists. This system helps to avoid any copyright issues, as it ensures that only authorized content is available for streaming.

Step 4 - Use Online Copyright Services
Many online tools can help you check the copyright status of a song quickly. Some of these services include Copyrightsearch.org, TuneCore, or Songtrust, to name a few. These services work by scanning various copyright databases and online platforms to find any copyright claims against music files that match the one you're searching for.

In conclusion, it’s essential always to check the copyright status of a song before adding it to your Spotify playlist. Always remember, infringement of copyrighted materials is an illegal offense that can lead to severe consequences. By following these steps, you can stay confident that your playlist is copyright-free and legally compliant. Happy playlisting!
