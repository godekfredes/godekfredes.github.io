# You Won't Believe How Easy it is to Create Windows Tools Shortcut in Windows 10!

If you are someone who frequently uses certain Windows tools or applications, you may have noticed how time-consuming it can be to navigate through the various menus and options to find the tool you need. Fortunately, there is an easy solution - creating shortcuts for your most-used tools. In this article, we’ll show you just how easy it is to create Windows tools shortcuts in Windows 10.

## Step 1: Locate the Windows Tools You Want to Create a Shortcut For

Before we start creating shortcuts, we need to identify the specific tools we want to use. Windows offers a range of built-in tools that can be accessed by going to the Control Panel or the Start Menu. Some popular examples include:

- Calculator
- Command Prompt
- Control Panel
- File Explorer
- Microsoft Edge
- Paint

Once you have identified the tools you need, you can move on to creating shortcuts.

## Step 2: Create the Shortcut(s)

To create a shortcut in Windows 10, follow these simple steps:

1. Right-click anywhere on the desktop or in a folder/file explorer window
2. Go to the “New” option in the context menu
3. Select “Shortcut” from the submenu
4. In the “Type the location of the item” field, enter the location or command for the tool you want to create a shortcut for. For example, to create a shortcut for the calculator tool, type in “calc.exe”, or for the command prompt, type in “cmd.exe”.
5. Click “Next”
6. Give the shortcut a name (e.g. “Calculator” or “Command Prompt”) and click “Finish”

That’s it! Your shortcut is now ready to use. You can double-click on the icon to open the tool directly, rather than having to navigate through menus.

## Step 3: Customise Your Shortcut

Creating a shortcut is easy, but if you want to take things a step further, you can customise your shortcut. Right-click on the shortcut and go to “Properties”. In the Properties window, you can change the icon, alter the keyboard shortcut or hotkey, and even assign a custom shortcut key combination to the tool.

## Conclusion

Creating Windows tools shortcuts in Windows 10 is an incredibly easy process that can save you time and streamline your workflow. By taking a few minutes to create shortcuts for your most-used tools, you can quickly access them without having to navigate through menus or folders. Give it a try and see how much time and hassle it can save you!
