# Revolutionize Your Internet Experience:
## Learn the Simple Hack to Boost Your PC's Internet Speed with DNS Settings!

Are you tired of slow Internet speeds? Do you find yourself getting frustrated with buffering videos and slow downloads? If you're like most people, you probably blame your Internet Service Provider (ISP) for slow speeds. However, your ISP may not be the only culprit behind poor Internet speeds. In fact, you can boost your PC's Internet speed with DNS settings!

DNS or Domain Name System is the backbone of the Internet. It's responsible for translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses. The ISP typically handles DNS resolution for your computer. But, your ISP's DNS servers may not always be the fastest or most reliable. This is where third-party DNS services come in.

Third-party DNS services, like Google DNS, OpenDNS, and Cloudflare, offer faster and more reliable DNS resolution than your ISP's DNS servers. By using these services, you can reduce DNS lookup times, resulting in faster Internet speeds. This is particularly beneficial when browsing the web or streaming videos.

So, how do you change your DNS settings? It's simple! Follow these steps to revolutionize your Internet experience:

### Step 1: Choose a third-party DNS service 

There are several third-party DNS services available. Some of the popular ones are Google DNS, OpenDNS, and Cloudflare. You can choose one based on your location and which service offers the best performance for you.

### Step 2: Change your DNS settings

Once you have selected a DNS service, the next step is to change your DNS settings. Here's how to do it on Windows:

1. Right-click on the Start button and select "Network Connections."
2. Click on "Change adapter options."
3. Right-click on your network adapter and select "Properties."
4. Select "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" and click on "Properties."
5. Select "Use the following DNS server addresses" and enter the IP addresses of your chosen DNS service.
6. Click "Ok" to save your changes.

If you're using a Mac, follow these steps:

1. Click on the Apple menu and select "System Preferences."
2. Click on "Network."
3. Select your network connection and click on "Advanced."
4. Click on the "DNS" tab.
5. Click on the "+" button to add a new DNS server and enter the IP addresses of your chosen DNS service.
6. Click "Ok" to save your changes.

### Step 3: Test your Internet speed

Once you have changed your DNS settings, it's time to test your Internet speed. Use a speed test service like speedtest.net to measure your Internet speed before and after changing your DNS settings. You should see a significant improvement in your Internet speed.

In conclusion, slow Internet speeds can be frustrating, but you don't have to suffer in silence. By changing your DNS settings to a third-party DNS service, you can revolutionize your Internet experience, and enjoy faster and more reliable Internet speeds. Follow these simple steps and start enjoying a faster Internet today!

Certain third-party DNS services often provide tighter security and faster performance than the one from your ISP. 
Such services include Google DNS, Cloudflare, OpenDNS, and Comodo SecureDNS. Here's how to change your PC's DNS settings to use an alternative provider.
First, let's look at how to switch the DNS server settings and then we'll check out some of the third-party DNS providers. The steps to change the DNS server vary between Windows 10 and Windows 11.

Also: The best Windows laptops
Notice that there are fields for preferred and alternate DNS server. The alternate server is used if the preferred one is unavailable or not responding quickly enough. Type the IP addresses provided by the service for both servers in the appropriate fields and click OK.

 
## Changing DNS server settings in Windows 11


In Windows 11, go to Settings > Network & Internet. Select the option for Advanced network settings. Click the entry for the type of connection you wish to modify: Ethernet or Wi-Fi. Then, select the option for View additional Properties. 
At the Properties screen, click the Edit button for DNS server assignment. In the window for Edit DNS settings, click the dropdown menu for Automatic (DHCP) and change it to Manual. Turn on the switch for IPv4 and type the IP addresses for the preferred and alternate DNS servers in the appropriate fields, remembering to add the dots in the right spots. Click Save.

 
## Should you change the IPv6 address?


Since the world has already run out of IP version 4 addresses, we've slowly been transitioning to IP version 6, which provides a much greater range of usable addresses. So does that mean you should also change the DNS servers for IPv6? Not necessarily. Most ISPs either don't support IPv6 or are still in the testing phase. 
You can check to see if your internet provider has jumped onboard the version 6 bandwagon. Browse to the Test-IPv6 website using your current connection. The results will tell you whether your ISP supports the newer protocol. If so, most third-party services do provide IPv6 addresses.

 
## Third-party DNS providers


Now that you know the process for changing your DNS server settings, let's look at a few third-party services worth trying.

 
## Google Public DNS


Google Public DNS is one of the most popular third-party DNS providers, handling name and IP address resolution faster than many other services. Google's DNS server is designed to protect you against spoofing attacks that try to redirect you to malicious sites. The company's website for its DNS service shares details about its performance and security features and offers an issue tracker and a user forum.

IPv6: 2001:4860:4860::8888 and 2001:4860:4860::8844

 
## Cloudflare DNS


Cloudflare DNS is another alternative DNS provider that aims to be faster than competing services. Cloudflare also vows that it won't log your IP address, a process used by many ISPs that gives them the ability to record the sites you visit.

 
## Cloudflare DNS addresses


IPv4: 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1
IPv6: 2606:4700:4700::1111 and 2606:4700:4700::1001

 
## OpenDNS


Owned and operated by Cisco, OpenDNS offers two free and two paid packages for consumers. On the free side, the basic package is OpenDNS Home, while the OpenDNS Family Shield plan can block adult content for those of you who have children at home.
For $19.95 a year, OpenDNS VIP can lock down Web browsing by limiting access to specific, white-listed domains. Priced at $20 per person for up to five users, OpenDNS Prosumer is designed for home offices and small businesses and kicks in protection against malicious domains.

 
## OpenDNS Home addresses


IPv4: 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220
IPv6: 2620:119:35::35 and 2620:119:53::53

 
## OpenDNS Family Shield addresses


IPv4: 208.67.222.123 and 208.67.220.123

 
## Comodo SecureDNS


Coming from a reliable cybersecurity company, Comodo SecureDNS is worth considering if you're concerned about your online security. The company's DNS service tries to protect you from phishing attacks and malware. SecureDNS also keeps a real-time list of malicious websites and warns you if you attempt to access one of them.

## Comodo SecureDNS addresses


IPv4: 8.26.56.26 and 8.20.247.20

 
## Change your router's DNS settings


Finally, you can easily change the DNS settings for all the computers and other devices in your home. To do this, sign into your router's firmware. Look for a setting for Internet or network setup and find the section for DNS addresses.
The existing option is likely set to get the addresses from your ISP. Change that to manually assign the addresses and then type the preferred and alternate addresses from the service of your choice. Change or apply the new settings.
