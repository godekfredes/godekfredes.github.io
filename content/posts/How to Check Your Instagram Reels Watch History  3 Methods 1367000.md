# You Won't Believe How Many People Don't Know This: 3 Secret Methods to Check Your Instagram Reels Watch History!

Social media has become a part of our daily routine, and Instagram is undoubtedly one of the most popular platforms out there. Instagram's reels feature is a great way to stay entertained, and the best part is that you can watch them without leaving the app. However, do you know how to check your Instagram reels watch history? If not, don't worry because we've got you covered. Below are three secret methods to check your Instagram reels watch history that you probably didn't know about.

## Method 1: Using Instagram Insights

Instagram Insights is a built-in analytics tool that provides information about your account's performance. While it's great for businesses or influencers, it's also useful for personal accounts. Here's how to use it:

1. Open Instagram and navigate to your profile.
2. Tap the three horizontal lines in the top-right corner and select "Insights."
3. Under "Content You've Shared," select "Reels."
4. Here you can see a list of your past reels, including the number of views, likes, and comments.

It's important to note that this method only works if you have a professional Instagram account. If you don't, proceed to the next method.

## Method 2: Using Your Phone's Screen Time

Did you know that your phone keeps track of your screen time? By using your phone's screen time, you can see how much time you've spent on Instagram and which reels you've watched. Here's how:

1. Open your phone's settings and navigate to "Screen Time."
2. Select "See All Activity" under the "Week" tab.
3. Scroll down and select the "Instagram" app.
4. Here you can see how many hours you spent on Instagram and which reels you've watched.

This method works for both personal and professional Instagram accounts, and it's also available on both iOS and Android devices.

## Method 3: Using Third-Party Apps

If the above methods don't work for you, there are third-party apps that can help you track your Instagram reels watch history. However, be careful when downloading third-party apps, as not all of them are trustworthy. Always research the app and read reviews before downloading. Here are some of the most popular apps:

1. ReelsWatch - Available only on iOS devices, this app tracks your Instagram reels watch history and provides analytics on your overall viewing habits.

2. StorySaver - This app is available on both iOS and Android devices and allows you to download and save Instagram reels to watch later. It also tracks your viewing history.

3. Insights for Instagram - Available only on iOS devices, this app provides analytics on your entire Instagram profile, including reels.

In Conclusion

Knowing how to check your Instagram reels watch history is essential if you want to keep track of the type of content you're viewing. Whether you use Instagram Insights, your phone's screen time, or third-party apps, make sure you're using a trustworthy source. Remember that your privacy and security are important, and never give out your Instagram login information to any third-party app or website.
