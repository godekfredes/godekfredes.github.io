## Steps to Block Intrusive Javascript on Chrome and Firefox


This article has decided to share some of the best chrome extensions and firefox addons to block intrusive javascript in 2020. So, let’s check out how to block intrusive javascript in Chrome and Firefox.

 
### For Google Chrome


Google Chrome comes with a few extensions which are really good at blocking intrusive Javascript. These extensions will allow you to choose which script to block and allow. So, let’s look at some of the best extensions you can use to block intrusive javascript from the Chrome browser.

 
#### ScriptBlock



For google chrome, we have one extension that you can easily use to manage your scripts on the browser better. And the extension is ScriptBlock. The script block is an extension that provides better control of javascript, iframes, and other unwanted content. It even can mitigate cross-site-scripting(XXS) attacks and drive-by-downloads. ScriptBlock works perfectly together with other extensions like AdBlock, AdBlock Plus, or Ghostery. You can add your trusted sites to a whitelist to not be affected by ScriptBlock. Open the above-shared link and then download and install the app and then you will see this extension will be blocking these scripts.

 
#### Scriptsafe


ScriptSafe is another interesting Google Chrome extension that works not only on Google Chrome but also on Chromium-based browsers like Vivaldi. The interface of ScriptSafe is spotless, and it blocks nearly all scripts by default. Sometimes, this feature breaks the web page; however, the extension also provides users an option to allow script.

Not only that, but you can also add the script to ‘Trust,’ which will not block the script. You can even deny any particular script, which will force the extension to block the script on any webpage. ScriptSafe also shows users the list of blocked content. Basically, it gives users the ability to block and allow scripts.

 
#### uMatrix



uMatrix is another best Chrome extension that allows users to control javascript, iframes, and plugins on Google Chrome. The best thing about uMatrix is that it automatically detects cross-site scripting attacks and drive-by downloads and blocks them. Apart from that, uMatrix also works with some popular extensions like Ghostery, Adblock Plus, Adblock, etc. uMatrix also allows users to whitelist scripts and sites. UMatrix is one of the best Google Chrome extensions that you can use to block javascript from various web pages.

 
### Mozilla Firefox


Like Google Chrome, Firefox also has add-ons that you can use to extend the browser’s features. Firefox also has a couple of add-ons that can help you to block intrusive Javascript on the browser. So, let’s look at some of the best add-ons you can use to block intrusive javascript from the Firefox browser.

 
#### NoScript Full Security Suite



Well, NoScript Security Suite is one of the best security Firefox extensions or add-on that you can use today. The great thing about NoScript Security Suite is that it’s absolutely free, and it’s open-source by nature. The Firefox add-on allows users to block javascript, java, flash, and other things. NoScript’s unique whitelist-based pre-emptive script blocking approach prevents exploitation of security vulnerabilities like Meltdown or Spectre.

 
#### Toggle JS



Similarly, like Chrome, we have one great add-on for Firefox: Toggle JS. A simple toolbar button to quickly toggle javascript between enabled or disabled. A green shield is shown when javascript is enabled, and a red shield is shown when it is disabled. You need to visit the link shared above and then download and install the extension.

 
#### NoScript


NoScript is very similar to the ScriptSafe, an extension for the Google Chrome browser. The NoScript for Firefox is one of the best addons you can use to block intrusive Javascript on the firefox browser. By default, the add-on blocks all the scripts that load automatically after opening a webpage.

However, the addon gives users an option to unblock the blocked scripts. The addon blocks scripts by domain, and it gives users an option to allow a script temporarily. You can also permanently allow all scripts on the page by hovering over ‘Allow all on this page.’
