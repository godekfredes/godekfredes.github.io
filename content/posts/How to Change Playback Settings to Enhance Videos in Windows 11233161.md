# Unlock the Hidden Power of Windows 11 - Transform Your Video Watching Experience with These Playback Setting Hacks!

Windows 11 has brought in a lot of changes to the table, designed to enhance the user experience on their PCs. One of the most significant changes in Windows 11 is the new and improved video playback settings. The latest update has included a heap of tweaks that users can do to optimize their media viewing experience. Here are some playback setting hacks that will unlock the hidden power of Windows 11 and help you take your video watching experience to the next level.

## Hack 1: Change the Video Playback Speed

One of the most under-utilized playback features on Windows 11 is the playback speed. It allows you to increase or decrease the speed at which videos play. It's a handy feature for when you're watching tutorials or lengthy videos and want to speed up the learning curve. To use this feature, right-click on the video player and select "Playback Speed." From there, you can select between 0.5x to 2x the speed of the video.

## Hack 2: Optimize Video for your Display

Windows 11 also offers you the option to optimize videos for your display type to ensure that they look their best. To do this, simply right-click on the video player, select "Video Settings," and then choose "Optimize for my display." Windows 11 will automatically adjust the video's resolution and tone to suit your display size and quality.

## Hack 3: Use GPU for Video Processing

The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is responsible for all the visual output on your PC. Windows 11 allows you to choose which GPU is used for video playback, allowing you to optimize the visual experience. You can choose from either the integrated GPU or the dedicated GPU based on your device configuration. To switch between the GPUs, head over to "Video Settings" -> "Hardware-Accelerated GPU Scheduling" -> "Use Hardware-Accelerated GPU Scheduling for video playback."

## Hack 4: Change Audio Stream Settings

Windows 11 also offers you the option to change the audio stream settings while playing videos. With this feature, you can alter the stereo, surround, or Dolby Atmos sound output settings to enhance your auditory experience. You can access this feature by right-clicking on the video player, selecting "Audio Settings," and choosing the audio stream option that best suits your needs.

## Hack 5: Enable Picture-in-Picture Mode

Windows 11 has introduced the Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode that allows users to continue watching a video in a small window while multitasking on other applications. This feature is beneficial for individuals who want to stay productive while watching a video simultaneously. To enable PiP mode, click on the PiP button located at the bottom-right corner of the video player, and voila! You're now free to move the mini-video player anywhere on the desktop while continuing with other tasks.

## Conclusion

With these playback setting hacks, you can unlock the hidden power of Windows 11 and improve your overall video-watching experience. Whether you're just watching movies or trying to learn something from online tutorials, Windows 11 has got you covered with an array of playback options that won't disappoint.

Yes, Windows 11 has a feature to control playback settings that automatically enhance videos for some apps. The only catch is that Windows 11 only controls the playback settings of Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps such as the Edge browser, Photos, Movies & TV, and the video apps that you download from the Microsoft Store.
Windows 11 can’t control the playback settings of videos playing on a web browser or any other video streaming app downloaded from third-party sources. Another thing that you should note is that the feature will only work on compatible hardware.
