Never Lose Touch Again: The Ultimate Hack To Notify All Your Whatsapp Contacts When You Change Your Number!

As our lives become more mobile, it's not uncommon to change our phone numbers multiple times over the years. Whether it's due to a new job, a new city, or simply wanting a fresh start, changing your phone number can be a hassle - especially when it comes to letting your contacts know your new digits.

Fortunately, if you're a Whatsapp user, there's a simple trick to ensure you never lose touch with your contacts again. With this ultimate hack, you can notify all your Whatsapp contacts when you change your phone number with just a few clicks.

Step 1: Open Whatsapp and go to Settings

The first step in this process is to open Whatsapp on your phone and go to the Settings menu. This is where you'll find the option to change your phone number.

Step 2: Tap on Account

Within the Settings menu, you'll see a variety of options. Tap on "Account" to access the section that pertains to your account information on the app.

Step 3: Tap on Change Number

Next, you'll want to tap on "Change Number". This will bring up a screen that asks you to enter your current phone number and your new phone number.

Step 4: Verify Your New Number

After entering both your current and new phone numbers, Whatsapp will send a verification SMS to your new number. You'll need to enter this code into the app to verify your new number and complete the process.

Step 5: Select Notify Contacts

Finally, after you've successfully verified your new phone number, Whatsapp will ask if you'd like to notify your contacts of your new number. Select the "Notify Contacts" option to send a message to all of your Whatsapp contacts informing them of your new number.

And that's it - with just five simple steps, you can ensure that all your Whatsapp contacts are aware of your new phone number. This process can save you time and hassle, and help you avoid missing out on important messages from friends and family after changing your number.

In addition to notifying your contacts, it's also a good idea to update your phone number on any other social media platforms or websites you use regularly. This will help ensure that your friends and followers can still connect with you even if they don't use Whatsapp.

Overall, the "Notify Contacts" feature on Whatsapp is a great tool that can help you stay in touch with your contacts no matter how many times you change your phone number. So next time you switch numbers, be sure to use this ultimate hack to stay connected with your friends and family!

The setup itself is largely straightforward and doesn’t require more than a few minutes. To get started, make sure you are on the latest WhatsApp beta version. In order to sign up for the beta channel, head over to this link and hit the “Become a Tester” button. The feature is still rolling out as a server-side update, therefore there’s a chance it might take a while to reach your region. It also seems to be limited to the Android counterpart as well for now.
Once that’s done, fire up the app, and navigate to the settings from the three-dot menu on the top. Go into “Account”, and lastly, tap the “Change Number” option. This is where you’ll be asked to input and verify your new number, hence ensure it’s active. Click “Next”, enter both the numbers and tap “Next” again.

Now, you should have an option to inform all your contacts about the change. Turn it on for more settings. You can either message only the people you’ve chatted with in the past or handpick them individually or of course, every one of them (which we don’t really recommend). Hit “Done” whenever you are ready and WhatsApp will notify the selected numbers regarding the update.
That is it for this guide, you are now all set with your new number. In case you are stuck at some step, let us know in the comments section down below.
