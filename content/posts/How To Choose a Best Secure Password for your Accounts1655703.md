Are Your Passwords Safe Enough? Here's The Ultimate Guide To Crafting Impenetrable Passwords And Protecting Your Online Accounts!

In today's digital age, our entire lives are online. From social media profiles to bank accounts and everything in between, our online presence is often protected by nothing more than a string of letters, numbers, and symbols. Yet, despite the obvious importance of strong passwords, many people still use simple and easy-to-guess combinations that make their online accounts vulnerable to hacking and identity theft. So how can you create impregnable passwords that keep your data secure? This article will cover everything you need to know about crafting strong passwords and shielding your online accounts from prying eyes.

What Makes A Strong Password?

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of creating strong passwords, let's take a look at what makes a password strong in the first place. The basic idea is simple: a strong password is one that is difficult for others to guess or crack. Here are some of the key characteristics of strong passwords:

- Length: The longer the password, the harder it is for hackers to crack it. A strong password should be at least 12 characters long.

- Complexity: Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces if possible. This makes it harder for attackers to guess your password using password cracking software.

- Use Different Passwords For Different Accounts: Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts. If a hacker gets hold of your password for one account, they can use it to log into all of your other accounts.

- Unique: Avoid using easily guessable passwords such as "password123" or "abcd1234". Instead, choose a unique password that is difficult to guess.

- Keep Your Passwords Private: Never share your password with anyone, and always keep it secret.

How To Create Strong Passwords

With these key characteristics in mind, here are some tips on how to create strong passwords that keep your online accounts secure:

- Use A Password Manager: Password managers are tools that create and store strong passwords for you. They also automatically log you into your online accounts. This is a convenient way to keep your online accounts secure without having to remember multiple passwords.

- Use Passphrases: Passphrases are longer versions of passwords that are made up of multiple words. For example, "MyDogAteMyHomework" is a passphrase that is easy to remember but hard to crack.

- Add Numbers And Symbols: Use numbers and symbols to add complexity to your passwords. For example, "Th3QuickBrownFoxJumpsOverTheLazyD0g#" is a strong password that includes numbers, symbols, and spaces.

- Use Acronyms: Create a password by using the first letter of each word in a phrase. For example, "I love cats and dogs" could become "Ilcad123!".

- Inspiration From Songs/Lyrics: Use popular song lyrics or quotes as a password, for example, "WeAreTheChampionsMyFriends". 

How To Protect Your Passwords

Now that you know how to create strong passwords, let's talk about how to protect them. Here are some essential tips to keep your online accounts secure:

- Use Two-Factor Authentication: Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts by requiring a second form of verification beyond your password. This could be a biometric scan or a verification code sent to your phone.

- Keep Your Passwords Offline: Avoid storing your passwords on cloud-based services, as these are vulnerable to hacking. Instead, store your passwords on an offline device such as a USB stick or in a physical notebook.

- Update Your Passwords Regularly: It is important to change your passwords regularly to avoid your online accounts being hacked. We recommend updating your passwords every 6-12 months.

In conclusion, creating strong passwords is an essential step to protect your online accounts from being hacked or breached. Strong passwords should be long, complex, unique and kept private, and you should never use the same password for multiple accounts. Additionally, protecting your passwords by using two-factor authentication, keeping them offline, updating them regularly, and using a password manager are all crucial steps to take for complete security. By following these guidelines, you can safeguard your online accounts from being hacked and keep your personal information safe.

But often, users set a very simple password for their accounts, which attackers can easily crack. No matter what you do to secure your computer from hackers, it is an open invitation for hackers to hack your accounts if your passwords are not unique and strong.

 
## Choose a Best Secure Password for your Accounts


There are many techniques to choose the best password for your accounts, and the tips we will share are easy to implement. Let’s get started.

 
### Use Shift+Numeric Numbers In Your Password



Alphabet passwords are easier to crack, but cracking special characters is tough. For example, you can use any number series to make them in a special character format.
Like 5669032 can be written in characters by pressing shift, and your password will become %^^()#@, which is very strong than a simple one.

 
### Use A Movie Dialog Trick To Set Password



You can use the first words of your favorite movie dialog or poem lines to set your strong password. For Example :
“If I were the same man that I was thirty years ago, I’d take a flamethrower to this place!”
This quote then becomes- IIw36m3Iw3yaI3af33p!

 
### Use Space In Your Passwords



Another best way to secure a password is to use space between your passwords. Also, this will be the best combination with the password, where we have both alphabet and special characters.
For example: Techviral7976
Using Shift on special characters and space between them can be best written as Techviral &(&^

 
### Use Keyboard Pattern To Set Passwords



You can use any random patterns of your keyboard to set your password for your online accounts. As you can see in the picture above. Set your pattern-type password. Also, to make this password more secure, use uppercase and lowercase.

 
### Using Your Personal Dates



Whenever you hear personal dates, eventually, you will think of your birthday or your relatives. However, this is not recommended, as birthday passwords are easy to crack.
You can try putting the joining date of your first job, a farewell party, etc. You can put up 3-4 dates and separate them with special characters.
Example: 11|09|2005_14|12|2007_08|03|2014

 
### Using Misspelled Terms



If you do many chats on Facebook, you will be friendly with this one. What we need to do here is put up a misspelled term on the password, or you can even use the short form of any sentence and mix it with special characters to make it strong.
Example: sheislookingatyou 7947
The sentence will become: cizlukngatu &($&

 
### Check Online How Secure Is Your Password



There is an online site available to check your password security. You can scan your password on the online site and make sure that your password is not easily crackable.
