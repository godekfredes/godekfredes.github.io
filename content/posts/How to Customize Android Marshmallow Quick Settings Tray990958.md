You can rearrange, remove, or add items to the Quick Settings tray quickly and easily. To mix things, drag them around. If you want to remove an icon. Drag it from its location in the Quick Settings tray to the Delete icon. If you want to add or re-add an item, tap Add tile. Then tap the name of the setting you wish to access quickly. The Quick Settings customization tool works reasonably well, but it’s still rough around the edges. That said, it works well enough that I could see building it out a little more. Making it easier to access.
