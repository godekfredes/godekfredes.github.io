# Unlock the Power of Your Chromebook - Learn How to Connect Your Android Device in Minutes!

Chromebooks are great devices for quick online browsing, light work, and education. However, many users don't realize their full potential, especially when it comes to connectivity with other devices. The good news is that if you have an Android phone or tablet, you can easily connect it to your Chromebook and enjoy a seamless experience. In this article, we'll show you how to unlock the power of your Chromebook by connecting your Android device in minutes!

## Step 1: Check Compatibility

To connect your Android device to your Chromebook, you'll need to make sure that both devices are compatible. Your Chromebook should be running Chrome OS 71 or higher, and your Android device should be running Android 7.1.1 or higher. You can check your Chromebook's OS version by clicking on the "About Chrome OS" option in the settings, and your Android device's version by going to the "Settings" app and selecting "System" and then "About phone."

## Step 2: Enable Bluetooth

Once you've checked compatibility, you'll need to enable Bluetooth on both devices. On your Chromebook, click on the "Quick Settings" icon in the bottom right corner of the screen, then click on the Bluetooth icon to turn it on. On your Android device, swipe down from the top of the screen to open the notification shade, then tap on the Bluetooth icon to turn it on as well.

## Step 3: Pair Your Devices

With Bluetooth enabled on both devices, it's time to connect them. On your Chromebook, click on the "Quick Settings" icon again and then click on the Bluetooth icon. Your Android device should appear under "Available devices." Click on it and select "Pair." You will then see a message on your Android device asking if you want to connect with your Chromebook. Accept the pairing request, and you're good to go!

## Step 4: Share Files and More

Now that your Chromebook and Android device are connected, you can share files, photos, and even text messages! In the Files app on your Chromebook, you'll see a section called "Google Play Files" where you can access files from your Android device. You can also use the "Messages for Web" feature to send and receive text messages from your Android device on your Chromebook.

## Step 5: Disconnect and Reconnect

When you're done using your Android device with your Chromebook, it's important to disconnect it properly. Go to the Quick Settings menu on your Chromebook and click on the Bluetooth icon. Find your Android device under "Paired devices" and click on the three dots next to it. Then select "Disconnect." If you want to connect your Android device to your Chromebook again in the future, simply follow the same steps we've outlined in this article.

By following these five simple steps, you can connect your Android device to your Chromebook in minutes and unlock its full potential. With Bluetooth connectivity, you can seamlessly share files and text messages between your devices, and enjoy a more intuitive computing experience. So, what are you waiting for? Get your Chromebook and Android device ready, and start connecting!

This should be considered a no-brainer for anyone who uses both Android and ChromeOS. The only caveat to this setup is that your Chromebook will be unlocked as long as your phone is nearby. Because of that, you'll want to be careful as to where you leave your Chromebook. Warning aside, I've always found this to be a must-do for all of my Chromebooks.
Let me show you how it's done.

 
## Requirements


To make this work, you will need the following:

 
A Chromebook running ChromeOS version 71 or newer (I'll be demonstrating with ChromeOS 103.0.5045.0).An Android device running at least version 5.1 of the OS (I'll be demonstrating with Android 12 on a Pixel 6 Pro).A Google Account.


With those things at the ready, let's make this connection.

 
## Connect Android to ChromeOS
 
### 1. Open Settings


Log into your Chromebook and open the Settings app either from the launcher or the system tray. If opening from the Launcher, click the Launcher icon at the bottom right of your desktop and locate the Settings app. If opening from the system tray, click the tray and then click the gear icon in the popup window (Figure 1).

 
### 2. Add your Android device


Click Connected devices in the left sidebar of the Settings app (Figure 2).
In the resulting window (Figure 3), click Set up associated with Android Phone.
In the Select a device drop-down (Figure 4), you will see a list of all Android devices associated with your Google account.Â 
Select the correct phone and then click Accept & continue. You will then be prompted for your Google Account password. Type the password and click Done. Click Done again, and then, back at the Connected devices page (Figure 5), click the ON/OFF slider (associated with your new device) until it's in the ON position.
You will, once again, be prompted for your Google account password. Type it and click Confirm.
And that's it; your Android phone is now connected to your Chromebook. Once you've taken care of this, make sure to expand the entry so you can enable/disable any features you want and also connect Messages (by clicking Setup - Figure 6).
Close out Settings, and you're good to go. Your Android device is now connected to your Chromebook.
