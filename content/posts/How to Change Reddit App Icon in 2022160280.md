Revamp Your Reddit Experience: Jaw-Dropping Hack to Change App Icon Revealed in 2022!

Reddit is a place where people come together to share their interests, news, and opinions. It is one of the most popular social media platforms, with millions of users from all over the world. However, despite its popularity, the app lacks in one area, and that is customization. The Reddit app icon is not something you can easily change, but that's about to change in 2022, thanks to a jaw-dropping hack that will revolutionize the user experience.

In the past, users were limited to the default icon, which was a white alien on a red background. This icon was a defining feature of the Reddit brand, but it did not give users the freedom to personalize the app to fit their preferences. However, with a new hack that's been discovered, that's all about to change.

The hack that will allow you to change the Reddit app's icon is simple but effective. All you have to do is download an app called "Shortcuts" from the App Store, create a new shortcut, and then add a custom icon to it. Once you've done that, you can replace the Reddit app icon with your custom icon, and voila! You now have a personalized Reddit app that represents you.

To make this happen, you'll need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Download the Shortcuts app from the App Store.

Step 2: Open the Shortcuts app and create a new shortcut.

Step 3: Choose "Add Action" and then select "Scripting."

Step 4: Search for "Open App" and add it to the shortcut.

Step 5: Tap on "Choose" and select the Reddit app.

Step 6: Tap on the three dots in the top right corner and choose "Add to Home Screen."

Step 7: Tap on the icon that appears and then choose "Choose Photo."

Step 8: Select your custom icon and then tap "Add."

Step 9: Name your shortcut, and then you're all done!

Now, whenever you want to open Reddit, you can open the shortcut instead of the app, and it will lead you to the Reddit app with your custom icon.

This simple hack has revolutionized the way Reddit users interact with the app, and it shows that with a little creativity, it's possible to personalize any app to fit your preferences. Whether you're a casual user or an avid Redditor, this hack will change the way you think about the Reddit app.

In conclusion, the Reddit app has come a long way in terms of user experience and functionality, but it has always lacked in customization. With the new hack that allows you to change the app icon, users can now personalize the app to fit their preferences. Whether you want to represent your favorite sports team, your favorite TV show, or your favorite food, this hack will help you revamp your Reddit experience and make it truly yours. So what are you waiting for? Get started today and create your custom Reddit app icon!
