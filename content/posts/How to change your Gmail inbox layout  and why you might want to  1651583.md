Revamp Your Gmail Experience with this Simple Layout Hack - You'll Never Want to Go Back!

If you're a regular Gmail user, you might have noticed that the default layout of your inbox can be quite overwhelming. With a never-ending list of emails, countless folders and labels, and an unending stream of ads, it's easy to feel overwhelmed and frustrated.

But, what if there was a way to simplify the design of Gmail, making it cleaner, and easier to use? What if you could even make it look more professional and stylish? That's where this simple layout hack comes in.

The following guide will walk you through the steps of revamping your Gmail experience with a simple layout hack, and how it will forever change the way you use your email.

Step 1 - Enable the Preview Pane

The first step in this layout hack is to enable the Preview Pane. The Preview Pane offers a split-screen view that allows you to preview and read emails without having to open them in a new tab.

To enable the Preview Pane, click the gear icon in the top right corner of your inbox, select "Settings," then choose the "Advanced" tab. Scroll down until you see "Preview Pane" and select the "Enable" option.

Step 2 - Change Your Theme

Gmail has a range of themes you can choose from to customize the look of your inbox. Changing your theme can make a significant difference in the overall appearance and functionality of your inbox.

To change your Gmail theme, click the gear icon in the top right corner of your inbox, select "Themes," and then browse through the available options. You can even upload your own background image to add a personal touch to your inbox.

Step 3 - Remove the Unnecessary Features

One of the main reasons Gmail can be so overwhelming is the endless list of features and functions. But, the truth is, most of these features are unnecessary and only serve to clutter your inbox.

To clean up your inbox, click the gear icon in the top right corner of your inbox, select "Settings," and then choose the "Labels" tab. From there, you can hide any labels that you don't use or need, simplifying the list of folders and labels in your inbox.

Step 4 - Install a Gmail Extension

Incorporating a Gmail extension can further simplify your inbox and enhance its functionality. One such popular extension is "Checker Plus for Gmail," which allows you to read, listen, and delete your emails without ever having to leave your current tab.

To install an extension, open the Chrome Web Store, search for the extension you want, and click "Add to Chrome."

By following these four simple steps, you can revamp your Gmail experience, making it cleaner, more functional, and stylish. The Preview Pane, personalized themes, hiding unnecessary features, and the installation of extensions all serve to create an easy-to-use and professional inbox.

In conclusion, give this layout hack a try today and see for yourself how it can revolutionize the way you use your email. Say goodbye to the clutter and frustration of Gmail and hello to a streamlined inbox that makes sending and receiving emails a breeze!

For example, by default, Gmail usually displays five tabs: Primary, Promotions, Social, Updates, and Forums. How do you change this to a layout more conducive to your idea of efficiency? Let me show you.

 
### Gmail offers a few customization options, such as:
 
Layout: How much information is displayed in the left pane.Theme: The global theme applied to UI.Inbox Type: The actual layout of the UI.Reading Pane: How the Reading pane is displayed.Email Threading: Whether or not email is displayed in conversation view.


It's the Inbox Type option that we're going to focus on because it makes the biggest difference in how Gmail is displayed for you. 

 
### Here are the options you'll find under Inbox Type:
 
Default: Displays your email in categorized tabs and can be customized.Important First: Removes the tabs and displays important emails (those from contacts) first.Unread First: Removes tabs and displays all unread emails first.Starred First: Removes tabs and displays starred emails first.Priority Inbox: Removes tabs and displays important and unread emails first.Multiple Inboxes: Removes tabs (and resembles the older Gmail interface).


The best thing you can do for yourself is to try each layout and see which one works best for you.

 
## Changing your Gmail layout
 
### 1. Log in to Gmail


The first thing to do is log in to your Gmail account in a web browser. 

 
### 2. Open the Settings pane


Next, open the Gmail Settings pane by clicking the Gear icon near the top right of the window. This will reveal the necessary settings for changing the layout (no need to click See All Settings; Figure 1).
Scroll down to the Inbox Type section of the pane (Figure 2).
In the Inbox Type section, select a different layout to see how it looks. One thing you might start with is the Customization of the Default layout. 

 
### 3. Customize the Default layout


Click Customize under Default, which will bring up the settings window for the Default layout (Figure 3).
In the resulting popup, you can enable/disable the different tabs. The only tab you cannot disable is the Primary. For example, if you don't receive emails from forums, disable that tab. 
Note: Any tab you disable will send an email that would normally be categorized with that tab to the Primary. You can also enable/disable starred messages in the Primary tab.
Each Inbox Type varies with what Customization Options they offer. For example:

 
The Priority Inbox customization will take you to the main Gmail customization window.The Multiple Inboxes customization allows you to manually configure the inbox (such as including sections for in:inbox new_than:1d, is:starred, is:drafts).


Once you've made your customizations, click Save and you're done.

As I said earlier, it might take some time for you to figure out which Inbox Type/Customization works best for you. The good thing is that Gmail gives you plenty of options to choose from, so you won't have to bother working with a third-party service.
Enjoy your improved Gmail layout!
