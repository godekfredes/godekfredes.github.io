# Say Goodbye to Boring Content with These Mind-Blowing Tips on Controlling Your Facebook News Feed!

Do you spend hours scrolling through endless posts on your Facebook news feed only to find that you’ve wasted precious time viewing content that is not only irrelevant but downright boring? If you’re nodding your head right now, don’t worry, you’re not alone. In fact, the average user of social media spends almost two hours a day scrolling through their news feeds.

Here are some mind-blowing tips that you can use to take control of your Facebook news feed, so that you’re only viewing the content that is most relevant and interesting to you.

## Tip 1: Follow Relevant Pages

One of the best ways to ensure that you’re viewing interesting content on your Facebook news feed is to follow relevant pages. By following pages that are relevant to your interests, you’ll be able to stay up-to-date on the latest news, information and opinions in your specific field or area of interest. For example, if you’re interested in cooking, you can follow pages that offer recipes, cooking tips and advice on nutrition. Similarly, if you’re interested in sports, you can follow pages that offer sports news, highlights and analysis.

## Tip 2: Mute or Unfollow Friends

If you have Facebook friends who consistently post content that is irrelevant or uninteresting to you, you can opt to either mute or unfollow them. Muting a friend means that you’ll still be friends, but you won’t see any of their posts in your news feed. Unfollowing a friend means that you’ll no longer be friends and you won’t see any of their posts in your news feed. While this may seem harsh, it’s one of the best ways to ensure that you’re only viewing content that is of interest to you.

## Tip 3: Use Facebook’s News Feed Preferences

Facebook’s News Feed Preferences allow you to customize your feed by selecting the type of content that you want to see. You can choose to see more or less of a specific type of content, such as photos, videos, or status updates. You can also prioritize specific friends or pages so that their content appears at the top of your news feed.

## Tip 4: Save Interesting Posts

If you come across a post that you find particularly interesting, you can save it for later so that you can read it at a more convenient time. To save a post, simply click the three dots on the top right of the post and select “Save Post”. You can access your saved posts later by clicking “Saved” in the left sidebar of your Facebook news feed.

## Tip 5: Engage with Your Facebook News Feed

Finally, engaging with the content on your news feed can actually help to improve the quality of your feed. By liking, commenting, and sharing posts, you’ll help to create a feedback loop that Facebook’s algorithms use to determine what types of content to show you.

In conclusion, there are numerous ways to take control of your Facebook news feed so that you’re only viewing content that is most relevant and interesting to you. By following these tips, you can say goodbye to boring content and start enjoying your time on social media again.
