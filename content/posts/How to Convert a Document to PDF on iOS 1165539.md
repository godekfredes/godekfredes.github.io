title: You Won't Believe How Easy it is to Convert Any Document to PDF on your iPhone!

Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you needed to share a document with someone, but they could only view it in PDF format? With the vast range of file formats out there, it can be tough to ensure that your documents are easily accessible to others. After all, not every program can read every type of file, which can be a real headache.

Fortunately, if you have an iPhone, you don't have to worry about these compatibility issues anymore! Converting any document to PDF on your iPhone is easier than you might think. In this article, we'll give you a step-by-step guide on how to do it.

Step 1: Download a PDF converter app

The first thing you need to do is download a PDF converter app from the App Store. Here are a few popular options:

- Adobe Acrobat Reader: Adobe's app is one of the most widely downloaded PDF converter apps. Apart from converting documents to PDF format, it also enables you to sign documents, annotate, and share them with others.

- PDF Converter: PDF Converter is another reliable app that lets you convert files to PDF with ease. With this app, you can convert documents, images, and even web pages to PDF.

- iPDFConverter: This app is easy to use and supports several file formats, including Microsoft Office files, image files (JPG, PNG, BMP), and more.

Step 2: Upload your document

Once you've downloaded your PDF converter app, upload the document you want to convert. Most apps allow you to upload files via email, cloud storage, or by browsing your files.

Step 3: Convert your document

After uploading your file, select the "Convert to PDF" option. The app will then convert your document to PDF format. Depending on the size of your file, this process can take a few seconds or a few minutes.

Step 4: Share your PDF

Once your file is converted, you can now share your document in PDF format with anyone who needs it. Simply select the "Share" option in your PDF converter app, and choose how you want to share it (via email, message, or cloud storage).

Final Thoughts

Converting documents to PDF on your iPhone is incredibly simple and can save you a lot of time and effort in the long run. Whether you need to share a contract, a presentation, or any other type of document, having it in PDF format increases its compatibility and accessibility.

So, the next time you need to share a document, don't let its file format stand in your way. Download a PDF converter app and convert with ease!

As a result, this has led to the rise of a plethora of apps and services on the internet which allow you to work with PDF — from creating one to editing and sharing it — irrespective of the platform. So, if you are looking for ways to convert a document to PDF, here are two ways to do the same.

 
### Convert Document to PDF using the native utility


With the inception of iOS 10, Apple quietly introduced a hidden conversion utility that offers the ability to convert any document into a PDF. However, unlike most of the other tools and features that are present right outright, this one is buried deep within the Print tool. So, if you are looking for a way to convert a document into PDF without downloading a third-party app, here’s how to leverage this native utility –
1. Open the document you want to convert to PDF.
2. Tap on the Share icon on the top right and choose Print from the list of options provided.

3. Now in Printer Options, pinch-out on the document to zoom out.

4. Here, tap the Share icon and select Save to Files.

5. Finally, choose the location you want to save the PDF to and hit Save.

Once that is done, your document will be saved as a PDF to your selected location in the Files app.
Although this method works without fail almost every time, irrespective of the kind of document file you are trying to convert, here are a few third-party apps that allow you to do the same, in case the native utility fails to deliver the desired output.
