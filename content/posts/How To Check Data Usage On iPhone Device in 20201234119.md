Many iPhone users struggle to monitor their data usage and end up paying more than they intended. In this article, we'll reveal some shocking data usage secrets and help you learn how to monitor your iPhone data like a pro in 2020!

## The Shocking Truth About iPhone Data Usage

Did you know that many apps on your iPhone use data in the background without your knowledge? It could be anything from automatic updates, syncing, or even push notifications. These hidden data-usage culprits could cause you to exceed your limit unexpectedly. Even some standard iPhone features, such as iCloud Backup and automatic app downloads, consume data without your knowledge.

Additionally, streaming services like Netflix and YouTube that use high-quality video settings tend to eat up more data than other apps. So, if you're addicted to streaming your favorite shows, you're likely using much more data than you think.

## How to Monitor iPhone Data Usage

The good news is, monitoring your iPhone data usage is easy, and you don't need any technical knowledge. In just a few simple steps, you can keep a close eye on how your iPhone uses data:

### Step 1: Check Your Usage Statistics

The first thing you need to do is check your iPhone's usage statistics. To do this, go to Settings > Cellular. Here, you'll find a list of all the apps that consume your data, plus their corresponding data usage. You'll also see your total data usage for the current period, which should give you a good idea of how much data you're using daily.

### Step 2: Set Data Notifications

To avoid exceeding your data limit, you can set notifications that warn you when you're consuming too much data. To set data notifications, go to Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data. Here, turn on the "Set Data Limit" and "Data Roaming" toggles. You can also set Custom Alerts if you want to be notified when you reach a specific data usage amount.

### Step 3: Manage App Data Usage

Now that you know which apps consume the most data, you can manage them to reduce your data usage. You can do this by turning off cellular data usage for apps that you don't need to use outside Wi-Fi. To turn off an app's cellular data usage, go to Settings > Cellular, and scroll down to the app you want to manage. Here, toggle off the "Cellular Data" option for that specific app.

### Step 4: Use Wi-Fi When Available

Using Wi-Fi is the most effective way to reduce your data usage. Whenever possible, connect to a Wi-Fi network to browse the internet, stream videos or download apps. You can set your iPhone to auto-connect to known Wi-Fi networks by going to Settings > Wi-Fi, and turning on the "Auto-Join" toggle.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, monitoring your iPhone's data usage is essential, especially if you're on a limited data plan. By following the simple steps we have provided, you can monitor your usage like a pro and avoid costly surprises. Remember, when in doubt, always use Wi-Fi, and turn off cellular data usage for apps that you don't need to use outside Wi-Fi.
