Revolutionize Your Productivity: Learn How To Create Professional Google Docs Templates for FREE with Workspaces Account!

If you're like most people, you probably use Google Docs a lot. It's an incredibly convenient and powerful tool for creating, editing, and sharing documents of all kinds. However, have you ever considered how much time and effort you could save by using pre-made templates?

Creating a document from scratch every time you need to write something new is not only inefficient, but it's also time-consuming. That's where templates come in. With a template, you can save yourself a lot of repetitive work because you already have a pre-built structure to work with.

Now, you might be thinking, "sure, but creating templates is a lot of work, right?" Not really! In fact, if you have a Workspaces account (which is free if you use Gmail), you can create professional-looking templates for Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides in just a few minutes. Here's how.

Step 1: Sign up for Workspaces

Go to https://workspace.google.com/signup, sign up with your Gmail account, and follow the on-screen instructions to create your account.

Step 2: Install the Workspaces Add-on for Google Docs

Once you're signed up, go to the Google Workspace Marketplace and search for "Workspaces" (or click here: https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/workspaces/854187144990). Click the "Install" button to add the add-on to your Google Docs account.

Step 3: Create a new template

Open a new Google Doc and select "Add-ons" from the top menu. Select "Workspaces" from the drop-down menu and then select "Create New Template." From there, you can customize the template to your liking, add placeholder text and images, and even save it to a shared drive or folder that you can share with others on your team.

Step 4: Use your new template

Now that you've created your template, you can use it any time you need to create a new document. Simply open your template, edit the placeholder text and images, and save it as a new document.

By using templates, you can save yourself a lot of time and effort in the long run. And, with Workspaces, creating professional-looking templates for Google Docs is easy and free! So, why not give it a try today and revolutionize your productivity?

So when you have a free Workspaces account, and you need to use your own templates, what do you do?
You follow this handy workaround.

 
## Creating your first template


The first thing to take care of is creating a template. Log into Google Drive and create a new folder called Google Docs Templates. To do that, click New, and then, in the popup (Figure 1), type Google Docs Templates and click Create.

Change into that new folder and then create your first template by clicking New > Google Docks > Blank document. In this new document, build your first template Figure 2).
Figure 2
Once you have your template built, click Untitled document (near the top left corner) and give the template a name, such as Book Template, (Figure 3).

At this point, you have your first template, saved in the Google Docs Template folder at the root of your Google Drive account. 

 
## How to use your new template


This is where things get a bit less than efficient. Unlike using a regular Google Docs template, where you simply open the template gallery (Figure 4), select the template you want, and get to work.
Figure 4
Let's say it's time to use that first template. What do you do? The new folder you created (and the contents within) does not show up in the Google Docs Templates gallery, nor is there any way to make it so. 
Back in that Google Docs Templates directory, right-click the template you just created and select Make a copy (Figure 5), which will create a new document named Copy of X (Where X is the name of your template.
Figure 5
Don't open the copy yet. Before you do, right-click the file and select Move to (Figure 6).
Figure 6
Select a new folder to house the copy of the template. Once you've done that, navigate to the folder housing the moved file, right-click it, select Rename, and give the document a new name. You can then open the document and get to work using the template.
This isn't the most efficient method of creating new templates in the free version of Google Workspaces, but if the selection of templates doesn't meet your needs, this is your best route to success. And although it might seem a bit cumbersome at first, once you get used to the workflow, it'll become second nature and you'll wind up with a collection of useful templates that perfectly fit your needs.
