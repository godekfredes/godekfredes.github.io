# Discover The Ultimate 5-Step Technique To Revive Your Apple Watch Like A Brand New One!

If you own an Apple Watch, you know it’s much more than just a regular watch. It’s a device that you rely on for everything from tracking your workouts to managing your daily schedule. However, with time, your Apple Watch can start to slow down and lose its luster. Fortunately, there are some simple steps you can take to revive your Apple Watch and make it feel like a brand new one.

In this article, we’ll take you through a 5-step technique that will help you bring your Apple Watch back to life:

Step 1: Clear The Clutter

Over time, your Apple Watch may accumulate a lot of clutter, including unused apps, documents, and other data that you no longer need. These can slow down your device and reduce its overall performance. Take some time to clear the clutter and delete anything you don’t need. This will free up space on your device and improve its performance.

To clear the clutter on your Apple Watch, follow these steps:

1. Open the Settings app on your Apple Watch.
2. Tap General > Usage.
3. Tap on any app to see how much space it’s using.
4. Swipe left to delete any app you no longer need.

Step 2: Update Your Software

Updating your Apple Watch software is essential because it ensures you have access to the latest features and fixes any bugs or glitches. An outdated software can slow down your device and affect its overall performance.

To update your Apple Watch software, follow these steps:

1. Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone.
2. Tap General > Software Update.
3. Download and install any available updates.

Step 3: Restart Your Apple Watch

Sometimes, all your Apple Watch needs is a simple restart to improve its performance. Restarting a device can help clear any glitches or hiccups in the system and get it running smoothly again.

To restart your Apple Watch, follow these steps:

1. Press and hold the side button until the Power Off slider appears.
2. Drag the slider to turn off your watch.
3. Press and hold the side button again until the Apple logo appears.

Step 4: Unpair And Pair Your Apple Watch

If you’ve tried everything else and your Apple Watch is still running slowly or experiencing issues, it may be time to unpair and pair your device with your iPhone. This process will erase all data on your Apple Watch, so make sure you have a backup before proceeding.

To unpair and pair your Apple Watch, follow these steps:

1. Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone.
2. Tap your watch at the top of the screen.
3. Tap the “i” icon next to your watch.
4. Tap Unpair Apple Watch.
5. Pair your Apple Watch again.

Step 5: Factory Reset

If none of the above steps have helped, it’s time to try a factory reset. This will completely erase all data on your Apple Watch, restoring it to its original factory settings. Again, make sure you have a backup before proceeding.

To factory reset your Apple Watch, follow these steps:

1. Open the Settings app on your Apple Watch.
2. Tap General > Reset.
3. Tap Erase All Content and Settings.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions.

In conclusion, these simple five steps can help you revive your Apple Watch and make it feel like a brand new device. From clearing the clutter to factory resetting your device, these steps are easy to follow and will ensure your Apple Watch is performing at its best.

You'd think we'd be safe from that with an Apple Watch, since we constantly have to remove it to charge it, but you'd be mistaken. 
All that dirt, dust, dead skin, and sweat still hides in the crevices of your watch, and it can even interfere with your Apple Watch's performance. 
An Apple Watch can collect too much debris around the Digital Crown, for example, causing it to get stuck. Much like the ones on your iPhone, the speaker ports on your Apple Watch are another usual victim to grime, and clearing those out can help if your speaker volume suddenly is too low.

## How to clean your Apple Watch in 5 steps
 
## Requirements 
 
Cotton swabsTwo clean microfiber cloths (or other non-abrasive, lint-free cloths)Clean waterDirty Apple WatchOptional: Interdental brush


Also: The best Apple Watch Series 8 bands 
To remove the band, place the watch face down on a flat, clean surface. Press down the band release buttons. These are the two buttons in the middle of where the band meets the watch. 
While pressing down the release buttons, slide the band out of place and remove it completely. 
Below are the buttons you need to press down while sliding out the watchband.

Try to loosen the stuck-on dirt from your watch's crevices with the cotton swab. If the grime isn't budging, try holding your watch under gently running water to loosen it up (see Apple's support page for information on how water-resistant your particular Apple Watch model is, and never use soapy water). Then give the cotton swab another shot. 
If you feel you can be extra gentle, you can try this method around the Digital Crown and on the speaker port (shown in photo below). Using an interdental brush to clean small spaces on your electronic devices is a great idea, provided you're extremely careful with it. Only use the sides of the brush, not the tip. And no matter how tempted you are, don't use compressed air to clean your Apple Watch.

 
## Can I disinfect my Apple Watch?


If you've owned an Apple Watch during the last few years, you've probably wondered if it's safe to disinfect your Apple Watch without damaging it. Apple has approved the use of some disinfectants to safely clean your watch:
Again, it's important to not use any soaps or cleaning products when you're cleaning your Apple Watch, and don't submerge your watch in water to clean it, especially not older models.
Whether you clean your band or not, it will fade or vary in color over time and with repeated use. Using cleaning products other than mild hand soap will exacerbate fading and discoloration, so again, steer clear of those.
To reassemble your Apple Watch, place it facedown on a clean surface again, then hold the band with the letters and numbers facing you, and slide each one into the slot until you hear a faint click.

 
70% Isopropyl alcohol wipe75% Isopropyl alcohol wipeClorox Disinfecting Wipes


This obviously doesn't mean that you can give your Apple Watch a scrubbing with a Clorox wipe, but you can gently wipe the exterior of the Apple Watch and band with one of these wipes, with the exception of leather and fabric bands.

 
## How do I clean my stinky Apple Watch band?


The sport band on the Apple Watch is unfortunately often plagued by a foul smell, particularly when worn during exercise. A good way to get smells like this out is to remove it from the watch and wash it well with hand soap, then dry it with a microfiber towel, and make sure it is completely dry before wearing it again.
If the smell persists, wipe it with an isopropyl alcohol wipe, especially the underside, and let it air-dry completely.
Also: New Apple Watch Ultra bands work with other Apple models, too

 
## Can I wash my Apple Watch in the sink?


Apple doesn't recommend washing its smartwatches with soap, as soap residue can get stuck in small areas of the watch and cause problems down the line. Depending on the model, this doesn't mean you can't shower with your watch or do dishes with it, however. Again, check the degree of water resistance of the model that you own.
You can wash the band in the sink with some mild hand soap, however, provided it's not leather.
I don't wash my Apple Watch in the sink, but every night before bed, I take it off and wipe it with a Clorox wipe, then let it thoroughly air-dry before charging it or wearing it again. 

 
## Can I clean an Apple Watch leather band?


Leather bands are not waterproof and can become discolored if cleaned wrong. If you have a leather band for your Apple Watch and need to clean it, you can use a slightly damp cloth to clean it, taking great care not to soak the leather. Let it air-dry completely before wearing it again, but don't put it out in the sun to do it, as it will become damaged. Air-drying your leather band inside is enough.

 
## What to avoid when cleaning the Apple Watch?
 
Avoid any harsh cleaners of any kind, as well as products containing bleach or hydrogen peroxide. Don't submerge your Apple Watch in cleaning solutions or soapy water. Don't submerge older models in water at all.Don't use compressed air or ultrasonic cleaning.Don't blow-dry your Apple Watch or leave it out in the sun to dry.Never polish or buff your Apple Watch.
