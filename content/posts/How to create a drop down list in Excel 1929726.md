# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Make A Drop Down List In Excel! See The Amazing Step-By-Step Guide Here!

Do you often find yourself entering the same data repeatedly in your Excel spreadsheet? Fret not, as Excel has a feature of creating a dropdown list to ease out this repetitive task. With this feature, you can quickly choose the data you want to enter in a cell, without having to remember or type it every time. In this article, we will take you through a step-by-step guide to creating a drop-down list in Excel. 

### Step 1: Open your spreadsheet and navigate to the cells where you want to create a drop-down list 

First things first, you need to open your Excel spreadsheet and decide which cells you want to create a drop-down list. These cells could be for any kind of data, including names, dates, or any other text or numbers. Once you are done selecting the cells, move on to the next step. 

### Step 2: Add the data you want to appear in the drop-down list

To create a dropdown list, you need to add the data you want to appear in the list. You can choose to add this data directly within the cells or in a separate column. For instance, if you want to create a dropdown list of products, you can add them in a separate column or the same column where you want to create a dropdown list.

### Step 3: Select the cells where you want to create dropdown lists

Once you are done adding the data, you need to select the cells where you want to create the dropdown list. After selecting the cells, click on the "Data" tab in the menu, and then click on the "Data Validation" option. 

### Step 4: Choose the "List" option in the Data Validation dialog box

On clicking the Data Validation option, a dialog box will appear. In this dialog box, select the "List" option in the "Allow" section. 

### Step 5: Specify the source for the dropdown list

Next, you need to specify the source from which the dropdown list will pick the data. For this, you need to click on the source box, and then select the cells where you have added the data you want to appear in the dropdown list. 

### Step 6: Click OK to add the dropdown list

After you have specified the source, click on OK to add the dropdown list to the selected cells. On clicking OK, the dropdown list will be created in the cells, and you can now choose any item from the list to enter the data.

### Conclusion

Creating a dropdown list in Excel is an incredibly easy and time-saving feature that can be used for a variety of data types. With the above-mentioned step-by-step guide, you can now create dropdown lists quickly and effectively. So, the next time you have to enter repeated data, just create a drop-down list, and save yourself a ton of time and effort.
