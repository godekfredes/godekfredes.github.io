## Unlock The Secret to Creating the Ultimate User Experience on Your Samsung Galaxy S8 with These Simple Navigation Bar Customisation Tips!


One of the things that make the Samsung Galaxy S8 one of the most popular smartphones on the market is its customizability. With a little bit of tinkering, you can make your smartphone truly your own, and that’s what we’re going to talk about today. Specifically, we’re going to discuss how you can customise your navigation bar to create the ultimate user experience on your Galaxy S8.

So why should you customise your navigation bar? Well, for starters, it’s a great way to make your smartphone more intuitive to use. This is especially true if you’re new to the Galaxy S8, as the navigation bar can take a little bit of getting used to. By customising it to your liking, you can ensure that you always know where your most-used apps and features are located.

Ready to get started? Here are some tips to help you unlock the secret to creating the ultimate user experience on your Samsung Galaxy S8 with navigation bar customisation.


### Tip #1: Add Buttons

One of the best things about the navigation bar on the Galaxy S8 is that you can add additional buttons to it. For example, if you frequently use the Screenshot or Screen Record features, you can add buttons for those functions to the navigation bar. This makes it much easier to access those features quickly and without having to go through several menus.

To add buttons to your navigation bar, go to Settings > Display > Navigation bar > Button layout. From here, you can choose which buttons you want to add or remove from the navigation bar.

### Tip #2: Reorder and Remove Buttons

Not everyone uses the same features or apps on their Galaxy S8, which is why it’s essential to be able to reorder or remove buttons from the navigation bar. For example, if you never use the Bixby button, you can remove it entirely from the navigation bar. Or, if you use an app frequently, you can move its corresponding button to the first position on the navigation bar for easy access.

To reorder or remove buttons from the navigation bar, go to Settings > Display > Navigation bar > Button layout. From here, you can tap and drag buttons to reorder them, or tap the three dots on a button to remove it entirely.


### Tip #3: Switch to Full-Screen Gestures

If you want to take navigation bar customisation a step further, you can switch to full-screen gestures. With full-screen gestures enabled, you can navigate your Galaxy S8 without ever touching the navigation bar. Instead, you use swipes and gestures to go back, go home, or switch between apps.

To switch to full-screen gestures, go to Settings > Display > Navigation bar > Full-screen gestures. From here, you can enable the option to use full-screen gestures for navigation.


### Conclusion

Customising your Galaxy S8’s navigation bar is an easy and effective way to create the ultimate user experience on your smartphone. With a few simple tweaks, you can make accessing your favourite apps and functions more intuitive and efficient than ever before. So why wait? Start customising your navigation bar today and take your Galaxy S8 to the next level of usability and functionality!

The Samsung Galaxy S8 is the first Samsung device to feature an on-screen navigation bar. Apart from the handy trick that the home button packs, the switch to an on-screen navigation bar on the Galaxy S8 also allows Samsung to offer one feature that many Galaxy owners have long asked for: navigation button customisation.
On the Galaxy S8 and S8+, you will no longer have to adjust to Samsung’s opposite order of navigation buttons. You can customise the navigation bar according to your liking, though the customisation options available are very limited. Nonetheless, read below to what aspects of the navigation bar on the Galaxy S8 can be customised and how to do them.

 
### How To Customise the Navigation Bar on Samsung Galaxy S8


On your Galaxy S8 or S8+, head over to Settings -> Display -> Navigation Bar. Here, you will find all the customisation options related to the navigation bar.
Change the color of the navigation bar
If you only want to change the color of the navigation bar, simply select one of the available colors from the ‘Background color’ section. You can also select a custom color from the color picker. The changes will be automatically applied. Do note that irrespective of which color you select, the navigation bar will automatically switch to white when the keyboard is in use.
Change the button order
If you want to swap the position of the back and recent apps key to be in line with how Google recommends them (Back, Home, and Recent Apps), simply select the layout from the Buttons layout’ section.

Make the home button more/less sensitive
If you frequently use the home button on the Galaxy S8 even from within apps or to wake up the device, you can adjust its sensitivity to make it more or less sensitive. Just drag the slider located under ‘Home button sensitivity’ to left or right to make the home button more or less sensitive.
Jump directly to home screen
I have already written about how you can use the on-screen home button on the Galaxy S8 to wake the device up. By default, using the home button to wake the device will take you to the lock screen. However, if you want, you can use the home button to directly wake the device and jump to the home screen — after entering your PIN/Password, if any. Just enable the ‘Unlock with Home button’ option to enable this functionality.
Sadly, Samsung does not allow one to add more buttons to the navigation bar which would have come in useful. Nonetheless, these limited customisation options are useful as well, and it is always possible that Samsung adds more of them with future software updates over time.
