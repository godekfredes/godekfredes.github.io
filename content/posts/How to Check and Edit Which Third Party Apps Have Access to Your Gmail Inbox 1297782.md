# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Control Who's Sneaking Into Your Gmail Inbox - Here's How!

Are you tired of receiving irrelevant or spammy emails in your Gmail inbox? Do you feel like your privacy is being invaded by unwanted messages? Worry no more! With a few simple steps, you can take control of who can sneak into your Gmail inbox and prevent unwanted emails from cluttering your space.

## Step 1 - Use Filters

Filters are like magic wands that can filter out the emails that you don't want to see. With a filter, you can automatically move incoming emails to the trash, archive them, or label them as spam. This is particularly useful if you receive a lot of promotional emails or emails from certain senders that you no longer want to hear from.

To use filters, go to your Gmail inbox and click on the three dots on the top right corner. Click on "Settings" and then select the "Filters and Blocked Addresses" tab. From here, you can create a new filter by clicking on "Create a new filter". You can then select various filter criteria, such as sender or subject, and choose what action you want to take on the filtered emails.

## Step 2 - Block Senders

If you receive unwanted emails from a particular sender, you can block them to prevent them from emailing you again. When you block a sender, their emails will be automatically sent to the spam folder.

To block a sender, open an email from them and click on the three dots on the top right corner of the email. Click on "Block [sender]" and then confirm the action. Simple as that! You won't receive any more emails from that sender in your Gmail inbox.

## Step 3 - Unsubscribe from Promotional Emails

If you're tired of receiving promotional emails from certain businesses, you can unsubscribe from their mailing list. To do this, simply open one of their emails and look for the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the email.

By clicking on this link, you'll be taken to a page where you can unsubscribe from the mailing list. Alternatively, you can use a service like Unroll.Me to unsubscribe from multiple mailing lists at once. This will not only declutter your Gmail inbox but also prevent your email address from being shared with other businesses.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, controlling who sneaks into your Gmail inbox is not as difficult as you might have thought. By using filters, blocking senders, and unsubscribing from promotional emails, you can declutter your Gmail inbox and protect your privacy. So what are you waiting for? Give these tips a try and start enjoying a clean and organized inbox today!

While Google has said it only offers trusted and relevant companies the ability to add that module in their applications, it’s safe to say your emails are not in the right hands. The only precaution you can take right now is to review all the third-party apps which have access to your inbox. Here’s how to do it.


 

Unlike Google’s approach to permissions, its settings page to revoke or edit them is quite straightforward.
For starters, head over to your “My Account” page and log in with your Gmail credentials if you haven’t already yet.
On the landing screen, you will be able to view and review all the third-party applications who have access to any of your Google data including Gmail.
To locate the ones with access to your Gmail inbox, all you need to do is search for “Gmail” by pressing “Ctrl + F” on a Windows PC or “Cmd + F” on a Mac.
If any third-party app has the right to read your emails, it will have a label called “Has access to Gmail” beneath its entry.
There is currently no way to get rid of just the Gmail access, sadly. The only option you have is to entirely cut off that service’s access by hitting the “Remove Access” button.



Hopefully, Google will soon revamp these permissions soon to specifically let the user decide what sort of information can an application read. The company has been time and again been at the center of a controversy because of its permissions architecture which unnecessarily tries to club a lot of critical settings into a single one.
