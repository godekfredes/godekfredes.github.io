Title: You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Bring Back Silent Mode In Android 5.0 Lollipop!

Are you tired of being disturbed by continuous notifications from your Android device? Do you miss the good old days when you could quickly switch your phone to silent mode? You're not alone. With the arrival of Android 5.0 Lollipop, Google removed the traditional silent mode, and users have been struggling to find a way to bring it back. 

But, what if you were told that bringing back silent mode is just a few taps away? Yes, you read it right. With a few simple steps, you can quickly bring back the silent mode on your Android 5.0 Lollipop running device. In this article, we'll show you how to do it using the Hugo writing format.

Step 1: Access Settings

The first step is to open the Settings app. You can do so by tapping on the Settings icon on your home screen or app drawer.

Step 2: Navigate to Sound & notification

Once you've opened the Settings app, scroll down until you find the 'Sound & notification' option. Tap on it to open the settings.

Step 3: Sound settings

In the Sound & notification settings page, you'll see various options, including volume and notification sounds. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and find the 'Interruptions' option.

Step 4: Interruptions settings

Tap on the 'Interruptions' option to open the settings page. Here, you'll see three options under 'When calls and notifications arrive':

- Priority interruptions
- None
- All

Step 5: Select 'None'

Tap on the 'None' option, and you'll notice that your device will be on silent mode, allowing you to focus on your work or other activities without getting disturbed by notifications and ringtones.

Step 6: Customize interruption settings

You can also customize priority interruptions for certain apps by tapping on the 'Customize' option. This way, you can choose to receive notifications from specific apps while keeping the rest of the notifications silent.

Wrapping up

In summary, bringing back silent mode on your Android 5.0 Lollipop device is incredibly easy. All you need to do is navigate to the Sound & notification settings, select 'Interruptions,' and select 'None.' You can also customize the interruptions settings by using the 'Customize' option. With these simple steps, you can quickly bring back the traditional and effective silent mode to your Android device. So, go ahead and give it a try!

Android 5.0 Lollipop brings with it quite a lot of new features and enhancements, but it has also regressed in certain areas compared to KitKat. One such area where Lollipop has severely regressed is Volume control.

The new notification system in Android 5.0 allows users to categorise their notifications into three segments: None, Priority and All. While this new system is better than the old one, there is one serious issue with it: the complete lack of a silent mode.
On KitKat and below, rapidly pressing the volume down key will automatically put the device into vibrate mode followed by silent mode. However, in Android 5.0 Lollipop, pressing the volume down button after the phone has gone into Vibration mode does nothing.
While it is possible to get silent mode by using Interruptions in ‘Priority’ mode, the whole process is time consuming and cumbersome at best.
Thankfully, quite a few methods exist to bring back silent mode in Android 5.0 Lollipop, which are pretty straightforward and hardly take any time. Below, we have highlighted two such methods: one for non-rooted users, and another one for rooted Android device users who have Xposed framework installed.
Method 1 (For non-root users):
Step 1: Download SoundHUD from the Google Play Store on your Android device running Lollipop. Start the app, and when prompted provide it with ‘Accessibility’ service access.

Step 2: SoundHUD will now replace the stock volume bar on your Lollipop running device. Now, when you press the Volume down button, the SoundHUD volume panel will show up.
Just like on KitKat and before, repeatedly press the Volume down button to put the device into silent mode now.
SoundHUD is a bit buggy and the volume panel might not show the correct volume level when you tap the volume button the first time. Make sure to cross check your volume level after changing it once.
Method 2 (For rooted/Xposed framework users):
If you are running Xposed framework on your Android device running Lollipop, you can install the ‘True Silent mode for Lollipop’ Xposed module to restore silent mode functionality. Unlike SoundHUD, the module is less buggy and works without any issues across all devices.

It does not, however, provide any notification when the device enters silent mode. The only visual cue for silent mode being activated is that the Volume bar becomes inactive as shown in the screenshot above.
