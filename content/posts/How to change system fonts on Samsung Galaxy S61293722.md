One of the benefits of Samsung’s TouchWiz interface is that it comes with a plethora of customisation options that allows users tweak nearly every aspect of the UI according to their liking.
One such feature that Samsung has included in TouchWiz since ages now is the ability to change the default font type. While seemingly minor, changing the font freshens up the UI a bit. The option to change the font is also present on Samsung’s latest flagship devices — the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge — though they are a bit too difficult to find.
If you are struggling to find the option to change the system fonts on your Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 edge, simply follow the steps below.
Step 1: On your Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 edge, head over to Settings -> Display -> Font. Users will find the option to change the system font as well as its size here.
Step 2: You can select any font displayed in the list by tapping on it. You will then be shown a preview of the font on the top of the screen. If you like the font, simply tap the ‘Done’ button on the top-right corner of the screen.

Step 3: You can also download additional fonts by using the ‘Download fonts’ option present at the bottom of the list. This will open up Samsung’s own ‘Galaxy Apps’ store with a list of all the fonts available for download. All the fonts on the store are paid, though they only cost $0.99.

If you are not comfortable using the Galaxy Apps store to purchase fonts, you can also head over to the Google Play Store and search for “flip font.” This will bring up a list of fonts that will be compatible with TouchWiz on the Galaxy S6 and previous Galaxy devices as well.
Step 3: You can also adjust the default font size on the Galaxy S6 from this screen to your liking. Keep in mind though that increasing the font size beyond a certain level will affect certain UI elements.
And that’s about it. Which is your favourite font on the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge? Drop in a comment and do let us know!
