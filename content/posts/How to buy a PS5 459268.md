Welcome, gamers! The PlayStation 5 (PS5) has finally arrived, and we know you've been eagerly waiting to get your hands on one. However, with the high demand and limited supply, it may feel impossible to secure your very own PS5. But fear not! We're here to help you unlock the secret to securing your very own PS5 with our ultimate buying guide.

Step 1: Check Your Budget

The PS5 is a high-end console, so you'll want to make sure you have enough money set aside for it. The console itself costs $499, while the digital edition is priced at $399. You'll also want to factor in the cost of games and accessories, which can quickly add up.

Step 2: Set Your Priorities

Decide which features are the most important to you. The PS5 offers improved graphics, faster load times, and a new DualSense controller with haptic feedback. The digital edition is more affordable, but you won't be able to play physical copies of games. Consider which option makes the most sense for you.

Step 3: Research Retailers

Knowing where and when to buy a PS5 is crucial. Keep an eye on major retailers like Amazon and Best Buy, as well as gaming-specific stores like GameStop and EB Games. Check their websites frequently and sign up for their newsletters to stay up-to-date on restocks.

Step 4: Use Stock-Checking Tools

There are numerous online tools that can help you track PS5 restocks. Websites like NowInStock and BrickSeek can alert you when a retailer has the console back in stock. Set up notifications to get notified as soon as a restock occurs.

Step 5: Consider Bundles

Some retailers may offer bundles that include the PS5 console, games, and accessories. While these bundles may cost more upfront, they can actually save you money in the long run if you planned on buying those additional items anyway.

Step 6: Be Quick and Persistent

When a PS5 restock occurs, act fast! These consoles sell out within minutes, so make sure you have your payment method ready and are logged into the retailer's website. If you miss out, don't give up. Keep trying and check back frequently. The more persistent you are, the better your chances of securing a PS5.

In conclusion, securing a PS5 may seem like a daunting task, but with our ultimate buying guide, you can increase your chances of success. Remember to keep your budget in mind, set your priorities, research retailers, use stock-checking tools, consider bundles, and remain persistent. Good luck, and happy gaming!

It may seem impossible to get your hands on one, but don't despair: You can purchase one with some planning and perseverance. 
Even though the console on its own was out of stock at the time of this writing, the God of War Ragnarok bundles, which include a console or a digital edition version with a game, are still up for grabs for anyone with a Sony account. (Update: Currently only the digital edition bundle is available.) Making an account is free and takes minutes. The console is periodically available for purchase on an invitation-only basis.
In general, if you see it's out of stock, it's worth trying again both immediately and later. Many sites post restock trackers with rumors and strategies for guessing when the console is likely to appear in specific stores. If you go that route, make sure to create accounts and save your payment information on the major retail sites in advance, so that you won't lose your chance to buy an in-stock PS5 while you're looking for your credit card.

## How to buy a PS5 from Sony
 
## Is it possible to buy a PS5 in store?


Yes; although it's often sold out at the major retailers, there are opportunities to buy one. For example, GameStop has consoles listed as "Pick up in store," which means that its stores sometimes have them in stock. (Currently both God of War: Ragnarok bundles are listed as available at some GameStop stores.)  
Availability fluctuates: Right now, it looks like the $500 PS5 console is out of stock, but the Ragnarok bundle, which includes the console plus the God of War Ragnarok game, is still available at a higher price of $560. I could add the bundle to my cart and potentially check out on the spot. I could also purchase the digital edition instead for $100 less, and an extra wireless controller for $75. (Update: The console bundle is currently out of stock, but the digital edition is still available.)
As I mentioned above, Sony is offering delivery at no extra cost, and delivery by Christmas Eve if you order by Dec. 14 at 11 am PT.

## Is there a way to get early access when PS5s are in stock?
 
## Why is it so hard to buy a PS5?


The short answer is that demand far exceeds how quickly Sony is able to manufacture the product. The chips that power the PS5 have been affected by global supply shortages. Sony has already sold 13 million PlayStation 5s since launching the product two years ago, making this its best-selling console.  

 
## Will the PS5 ever be easily available?


The shortage issues are projected to clear up in the new year. In the meantime, if you're willing to buy a package that includes a game, you can may be able to get one from a physical store or directly from Sony -- and just in time for the holidays.
