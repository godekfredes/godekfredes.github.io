Revolutionize Your Billing Strategy: Learn How To Charge Clients By The Minute or Hour!

Billing can be a tricky process for any business. Hours spent on invoicing and chasing payments can distract from more important tasks. Along with that, outdated billing models can hamper productivity and even drive away clients. The solution? Revamp your billing strategy and embrace modern billing techniques, such as charging clients by the minute or hour.

Traditionally, firms have charged clients using flat fees for projects. This may not reflect actual hours invested, leading to scenarios where firms end up losing money or undercharging. Billing clients by the minute or hour can offer a better solution, where actual costs are tracked and charged, and invoicing becomes more streamlined.

If you are considering changing your billing model, here are some benefits of charging by the minute or hour:

Accurate cost allocation: Charging by the minute or hour ensures that you are billing for actual time spent on the project. It can give a client a more accurate understanding of the costs they will incur as the work progresses, potentially reducing the likelihood of surprises at the end of a project.

Clear accountability: Accurate billing based on actual time can make both parties more accountable. This is because clients will know what they are paying for and can hold their vendor accountable to complete work quickly and efficiently.

Quick payments: By charging in smaller increments, the time taken between billing and payment can be reduced. This will be beneficial for small companies which rely on cash flow.

Improved profitability: Charging by the minute or hour results in more accurate billing. This, in turn, helps firms to achieve better profit margins. It allows firms to better price the work performed resulting in a more balanced return on investment.

While charging by the minute or hour comes with several benefits, it's important to keep a few things in mind.

Firstly, it's key to find an invoicing system that allows you to track time easily. This will help you bill clients with ease while also freeing up time which can be used more productively.

Secondly, ensure that your team is aware of the new billing model, so they charge their time accurately. This will ensure that billing remains consistent across the organization.

Lastly, it's important to communicate the new policy with clients transparently. Explaining how billing by the minute or hour will work and how it will affect their costs will create a smooth transition, and it can help foster long-term relationships based on trust and transparency.

In conclusion, firms looking to boost productivity, increase profitability, and streamline invoicing procedures should consider charging by the minute or hour. By embracing this method, the billing process becomes more transparent, and payments can be streamlined. It also ensures that the work performed is priced more accurately, making it more beneficial both for the client and your business. So, don't hesitate! Revolutionize your billing strategy and achieve your full potential!

## Freshbooks automates accounting


Freshbooks automates the accounting process and integrates time tracking as a major feature. To start a timesheet, all you need to do is open the in-app timer and start it. The app will count down the minutes and hours as you work, leaving an accurate log that automatically calculates your rate and time together.
With this feature, you won’t just know how long you spent on a project, you’ll know how much you earned at the end of your session. The service even works with teams of multiple users, so everyone can keep track of the time they spend at your business.
The price of Freshbooks depends on the number of clients you work with. If you have five or fewer, the program can cost as little as $6 per month. For 500 billable clients or less, it’s $20.00 per month. 
Custom plans are available for bigger companies, so contact Freshbooks to find your options.

 
## Zoho Invoice for time tracking and project management


Zoho Invoice is a solid choice for independent contractors, emphasizing — you guessed it — invoices. 
When you create an invoice, you’re usually telling a client about services rendered in addition to their final bill. However, when it comes to hourly rates, you usually need to state the exact amount of time you spend on a given project alongside your rate. 
Zoho Invoice lets you track time while you’re working, even while you’re using other parts of the software. You can also send retainer invoices for advance payments, so you can collect upfront and have that portion taken out of your final invoices automatically.
Zoho Invoice is free to use for businesses with five clients or less. Rates go up to $30 per month for unlimited invoicing. Premium plans grant additional access to up to 10 users.

 
## Xero provides more than just business accounting


Like Zoho, Xero emphasizes invoicing when it comes to time tracking. The software’s strength lies in its ability to automatically convert a timesheet into an invoice for customers and your records.
You can track your time via Xero’s mobile app, too. It will then connect your data to your desktop client, which means you’re never without your timer, no matter where your job takes you.
And when the time comes for record-keeping, you can automatically generate reports based on your timesheets without retyping all the data. Who needs a bookkeeper, anyway?
Xero offers a free trial if you have five clients or less, with prices up to $60 per month for unlimited invoicing.
