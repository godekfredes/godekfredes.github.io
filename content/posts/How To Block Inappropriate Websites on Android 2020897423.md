Title: Protect Your Kids Online! Here's the Ultimate Guide to Blocking Inappropriate Websites on Your Android Phone in 2020

Introduction:
The internet is a vast and wonderful place, but it can also be a dangerous one, especially for children. As technology has advanced, kids have become more exposed to inappropriate content online than ever before. This is a serious concern for parents, who want to protect their children from exposure to obscene material, cyberbullying, and online predators.

As a parent, you can take a few simple steps to safeguard your child's online experience. One of the most important is to block inappropriate websites on your Android phone. In this guide, we'll show you how to do just that.

Step 1: Install a Parental Control App

There are many parental control apps available for Android phones, and they are an easy way to block inappropriate sites. One of the most popular is Kaspersky SafeKids, which allows you to control what content your child can access, as well as track their location and screen time.

Other popular parental control apps include Norton Family, Qustodio, and Net Nanny. Choose the one that suits your needs the best and install it on your Android phone.

Step 2: Configure Parental Controls

Once you have installed a parental control app, you will need to configure it to block inappropriate websites. This process varies depending on the app you choose, but most parental control apps have a similar setup process.

Typically, you will need to create a profile for your child, which includes their age and the types of content you want to block. You can then set up specific rules for each category of content, such as adult websites, gambling sites, and social media.

Step 3: Set Up Filters

In addition to blocking specific content categories, you can also set up filters to block individual websites. Most parental control apps will allow you to add specific URLs to a block list, which prevents your child from accessing them.

To create a block list, simply add the URLs of any inappropriate websites that you want to block. This can be particularly useful for blocking sites that may not fit into a specific category, such as online stores that sell adult items.

Step 4: Monitor Your Child's Activity

Even with parental controls in place, it's important to monitor your child's online activity. Most parental control apps allow you to track your child's browsing history, so you can see what sites they have visited.

It's also a good idea to talk to your child about the dangers of the internet and the importance of staying safe online. This will help them understand why you are using parental controls and why it's important to be careful when browsing the internet.

Conclusion:
In today's world, it's more important than ever to protect your child's online experience. By using parental control apps to block inappropriate websites on your Android phone, you can help keep your child safe from cyberbullying, online predators, and exposure to inappropriate content.

Follow the above-mentioned steps to configure parental controls, create a block list, and monitor your child's activity to ensure their safety. With these precautions in place, your child can enjoy a safe and fun online experience.
