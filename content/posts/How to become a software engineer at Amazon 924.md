Becoming a software engineer at Amazon requires the right education and training. A degree in computer science or a related field will give you the foundation you need to enter the technology industry. Additionally, it’s essential to keep up with the latest advancements in technology and programming languages. This can be done by attending workshops, taking online courses, and participating in coding competitions.

Step 2: Build a Strong Portfolio

Having a strong portfolio is essential for showing your skills as a software engineer. It showcases your past projects, your programming languages, and your expertise. A good portfolio will demonstrate your ability to develop software applications, solve problems, and work on a team. Amazon looks for software engineers who have experience with popular development frameworks such as React, Angular, and Node.js. Make sure your portfolio includes projects that demonstrate your ability to work with these frameworks.

Step 3: Practice Your Coding Skills

Coding is the backbone of software engineering, and practicing your coding skills is essential for becoming a sought-after software engineer at Amazon. Writing code is a complex process that requires practice. You should regularly practice solving coding challenges, and you can use sites like HackerRank or LeetCode to help you. Additionally, you can contribute to open-source projects to improve your coding skills and gain experience.

Step 4: Network

Networking is crucial for any profession, and software engineering is no exception. Attend tech conferences, join online communities, and connect with other software engineers on social media. Networking will help you stay informed about the latest trends in technology and connect with potential employers.

Step 5: Prepare for Interviews

The interview process is rigorous at Amazon, and it’s essential to prepare yourself for it. Research the company’s mission, values, and culture before the interview. Additionally, practice answering coding questions and problem-solving to improve your performance during the interview. Finally, don’t forget to bring your portfolio and your coding samples to showcase your skills.

Conclusion

Software engineering is a highly sought-after profession, and Amazon is one of the most prestigious technology companies in the world. Becoming a software engineer at Amazon requires the right education, training, and skills. Practice your coding skills, build a strong portfolio, network, and prepare for interviews to increase your chances of landing a job at Amazon. The tech elite is waiting for you!

## 0. Check your readiness.
 
A bachelor's in software developmentFamiliarity with C++, Java, and PythonOver five years' professional experience


It might make more sense to wait until you have gained the necessary skills and experience.

 
## 1. Update your materials.


Make sure your application materials are in order. Double-check your resume for typos or outdated information. 
Update professional profiles on sites like LinkedIn, GitHub, and HubSpot.

 
## 2. Research the application process and set your expectations.


Adjust your resume to fit each position better by using keywords from the listing or emphasizing specific credentials. Competition is fierce, so only apply to jobs where you match at least 85% of the listed qualifications. 

 
## 4. Take assessments.
 
### Work style assessment
 
### Work sample simulation
 
## 5. Wait for a screener call.


The screener call assesses your career trajectory over the past five years and how your competencies align with the position. 
You can prepare for the screener call by preparing concise, substantive answers to the following questions:

 
What have been your greatest career achievements?What have been your biggest career failures?Why did you stay on with/leave each position?
 
## 6. Prepare for additional interviews.


Generally, the first interview is with the hiring manager — your potential future supervisor. 
Next is a day packed with four to five 60-minute "loop" interviews with software engineering team members, some on teams related to your desired position, others from completely different teams. Each interviewer asks about leadership competencies and technical skills, which are covered below.

 
### Leadership competencies


Prepare your list of relevant career experiences to date ahead of time. Follow this link for some helpful examples that showcase leadership competencies.

 
### Technical skills


Next in the interview process comes technical questions, which fall into two categories:

 
System design competency: Measures your ability to black-box design a software systemCoding competency: Measures your abilities at programming coding languages including C++, Java, and Python


The coding competency category is divided into three subcategories:

 
Logical and maintainableData structures and algorithmsProblem-solving


During this part of the interview, you will be expected to answer technical questions, using personal career examples to illustrate, and demonstrate your ability to improvise to solve problems. 

 
## 7. Skill up and try again.


Considering the overwhelming number of applications each posting attracts, getting an interview or job is largely down to luck.
Treat the experience as a learning opportunity. Take notes on your interview performance and brainstorm ways to improve.
Consider pursuing more training through a coding bootcamp or by earning your software engineering master's.

 
## In conclusion


You'll need confidence in your successes and the ability to explain how you will recreate them.
