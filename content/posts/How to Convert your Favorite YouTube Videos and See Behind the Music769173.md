If you're a Youtube addict, you know how frustrating it can be when your favorite video is only available online. Maybe you want to watch it offline or save it for later use. Perhaps you want to extract unseen footage from your favorite youtube video that was never made available to the public. Whatever the reason may be, you can convert your favorite youtube videos with the techniques outlined here.

There are many benefits to converting youtube videos. For one, you can view them offline or on your preferred media player without worrying about buffering or data charges. Additionally, converting Youtube videos enables you to extract unseen footage that may not be publicly available, such as deleted scenes or bloopers.

In this conversion guide, we'll show you the steps to convert your favorite youtube videos into various formats, including MP4, AVI, and FLV. We'll also help you with accessing unseen footage and cleaning up the video in case the quality is poor. With that said, let's dive into the steps.

## Step 1: Install a reliable Youtube downloader

The first step in converting your favorite youtube videos is to install a reliable youtube downloader. Several youtube downloader tools are available online, and you want to ensure that you choose a trustworthy one. Our top picks include:

Once you've downloaded and installed the downloader of your choice, open the program and follow the prompts to configure it.

## Step 2: Copy the Youtube video URL

Next, go to Youtube and find the video you want to convert. Copy the video's URL by highlighting the text in the address bar and pressing Ctrl+C or right-clicking and selecting "Copy."

## Step 3: Paste the video URL into the downloader

Now, open your Youtube downloader and paste the copied URL into the designated field. Select your preferred video format from the dropdown menu, such as MP4, AVI, or FLV.

## Step 4: Convert the Youtube video

When you're ready, click the "Download" button to start the conversion process. Your video will begin downloading and, depending on the file size, can take anywhere from several minutes to an hour or more.

## Step 5: Access unseen footage (optional)

If you're looking to extract unseen footage or hidden scenes from your favorite youtube video, there are several tools that you can use. Video editors like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro can be used to open the downloaded video and search for footage that isn't a part of the final edit. However, if you're looking for a free tool, try using Videopad, Shotcut, or OpenShot.

More importantly, some youtube videos have deleted scenes or unused footage. Several tools help you download these deleted videos from platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Tiktok. Some of these tools include:

Once you've used these tools, you can now extract deleted scenes or unseen footage that may not have been available before.

## Step 6: Clean up the video (optional)

Suppose the video quality is substandard or the audio is muffled. In that case, you can use various video editors to fine-tune the video's quality. Ensure that you use editing software that will not compress or damage the video quality. Some of the best free video editors include Shotcut, OpenShot, and Lightworks.

## Conclusion

How sound is produced and how it moves
A vibration can be created in any physical environment, like air or water. In the air, the vibration creates longitudinal waves through which sound travels. These waves can either have high or low pressure. That’s why we can hear multiple pitches of sound. The longer the wavelength the lower the pitch.
Mp3 compression – intelligent selection at its finest
Lossy compression is especially popular when used to save space and reduce file size. When speaking of compressing sound, many things come into play, however, this is one of the most widely used compression techniques.
The mp3 format uses lossy compression to condense audio files so as to make them smaller and, while some might argue that this process reduces quality, the actual outcome implies a way to save a large number of files in a much more reduced volume of space. The smart way this particular compression takes place selectively eliminates only that information which cannot be perceived. In other words, you have to be a highly trained specialist or use special software in order to hear that bits of sound were extracted from the audio.
Why humans and music go so well together
There are tons of musical styles, genres and artists, each with their own, individual styles and ways of getting a message across, whatever that message might be.
Music can be a form of therapy, a way to safely express your inner feelings, and a way to feel more relaxed.
This is the main reason YouTube’s popularity has boomed since it was first introduced to the public. Listening to music is the main reason people go on YouTube nowadays. So the creation of tools to complement YouTube videos was only natural.
