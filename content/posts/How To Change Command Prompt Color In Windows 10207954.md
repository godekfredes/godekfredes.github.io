# Revamp Your Boring Command Prompt with These Easy Windows 10 Color Hacks!

As a Windows 10 user, you might have noticed that the default command prompt interface looks plain and boring. But did you know there are easy ways to add some colors and make your command prompt look more appealing? In this article, we’ll share some simple tips to revamp your boring command prompt with easy Windows 10 color hacks!

## The basics of the command prompt and how to access it

Before we dive into the color hacks, let’s first understand the basics of the command prompt and how to access it. The command prompt is a text-based interface that allows you to execute commands and perform tasks on your computer. To access it, open the start menu and search for “command prompt” or press the Windows key + R and type “cmd” in the Run box.

Once you have opened the command prompt, you can start using the various commands to perform tasks such as navigating folders, running executable files, and changing system settings.

## Adding some color using the Properties menu

One of the easiest ways to add some color to your command prompt is to use the Properties menu. To access it, right-click on the title bar of the command prompt window and select “Properties”.

In the Properties menu, you can select the “Colors” tab to choose the color scheme for your command prompt. You can also choose the font and font size from the “Font” tab. Once you have made your selections, click “OK” to apply the changes.

## Using the color command to change text and background colors

Another way to add color to your command prompt is to use the color command. This command allows you to change the text and background colors of the command prompt.

To use the color command, type “color” followed by two hexadecimal digits. The first digit represents the background color, and the second digit represents the text color. For example, to set the background color to blue and the text color to white, you would type “color 1f” and press enter.

You can experiment with different color combinations to find the one that suits your style.

## Creating custom color schemes using registry tweaks

If you’re feeling adventurous, you can create custom color schemes for your command prompt by tweaking the registry. This method requires some technical knowledge and should only be attempted by advanced users.

To create a custom color scheme, you need to navigate to the following registry key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console. From there, you can create a new value with the name “ColorTable00” and a data type of “REG_DWORD”. The value data represents the color of the first color in the command prompt color scheme.

You can repeat this process to create values for each color in the color scheme. Once you have created all the necessary values, you can open the command prompt and select your custom color scheme from the Properties menu.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, adding some color to your command prompt is a simple and fun way to personalize your Windows 10 experience. Whether you prefer a classic monochrome look or a colorful scheme, there are easy ways to modify the appearance of your command prompt. So, give these Windows 10 color hacks a try and spice up your command prompt today!
