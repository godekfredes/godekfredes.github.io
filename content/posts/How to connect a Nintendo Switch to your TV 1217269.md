# Revolutionize Your Gaming Experience: Follow These Easy Steps to Link Your Nintendo Switch with Your TV

If you are a gaming enthusiast, then you know the excitement of playing video games on a bigger screen. And with the Nintendo Switch, you can take your gaming experience to the next level by linking it with your TV. In this article, we will guide you through the easy steps to connect your Nintendo Switch with your TV.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Nintendo Switch

First, make sure that your Nintendo Switch is charged and turned off. Then, remove it from the dock, and locate the HDMI cable that came with your Switch.

## Step 2: Locate the HDMI Port on Your TV

Most modern TVs come with at least one HDMI port, which is the standard connection for high-definition video and audio. Check the back or side of your TV to find the HDMI port.

## Step 3: Connect the HDMI Cable to Your Switch

Insert one end of the HDMI cable into the HDMI port on your Switch, and the other end into an available HDMI port on your TV.

## Step 4: Power Up Your Nintendo Switch

Turn on your TV and select the HDMI input that is connected to your Nintendo Switch. Then, turn on your Switch by pressing the power button on the top-left side of the device. Your TV should now display the Nintendo Switch home screen.

## Step 5: Adjust the TV Settings

If your TV does not automatically adjust to the correct resolution for your Nintendo Switch, you may need to manually adjust it. Navigate to the settings menu on your Switch and select TV output. From there, you can change the resolution to match your TV's capabilities.

## Step 6: Enjoy Your Gaming Experience!

Now that your Nintendo Switch is connected to your TV, you can enjoy playing your favorite games on a bigger screen. You can even use the Joy-Cons or a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller to play wirelessly from the comfort of your couch.

## Conclusion

Connecting your Nintendo Switch to your TV is a simple and easy process that can revolutionize your gaming experience. By following these easy steps, you can enjoy playing your favorite games on a bigger screen and take your gaming to new heights. So, what are you waiting for? Grab your Nintendo Switch, connect it to your TV, and enjoy hours of gaming fun!

The company wisely made the process of switching between these two modes as easy as dropping your Switch handheld unit into its included dock. 
But, you'll still need to connect that dock's video output to your TV to get started.

We're going to show you how to do just that in only a couple of minutes. 

 
## How to connect a Nintendo Switch to you TV
 
## Requirements 


You'll need your Nintendo Switch and its included dock, your TV of choice, and an HDMI cable (included with the Switch). The process should only take a couple of minutes, maybe even less.  

 
## Why is my Nintendo Switch not connecting to my TV? 


First, check that all connections are secure, including both ends of your HDMI cable and the Switch's power cable. Next, make sure the Nintendo Switch handheld is correctly seated in its dock and powered on. Finally, ensure that your TV is set to the correct input for the HDMI port the switch is connected to, the HDMI 1 input for HDMI In 1, for example. If you confirm all of these aspects of your hardware connection are correct and still don't see output, try a different HDMI cable or HDMI port on your TV as the first of either of these could be faulty. Remaining issues might, unfortunately, include hardware problems with your Switch, its dock, or your TV. 
For the both the original and OLED docks, you need to pop open a rear door to access this port. Simply place your finger beneath the door and pull until it pops open. Once inside, you'll see the I/O ports shown in the image above, or a nearly identical set of ports for the OLED version.

Whichever cable you use, the process is the same. Simply plug one end into the HDMI Out port on the back side of your Switch's dock. Once this is done, and all of your other required cables (power and USB or LAN) are also connected, you can close up the Switch's back panel with your cables routed out of the provided opening. 
Find an empty port and plug the other end of the cable you connected to your Switch into the TV there. Finally, turn on your TV and set it to the correct input for the port you chose, HDMI 1 for HDMI In 1, for example.

## Can I connect my Switch to the TV without the included dock? 


Yes. If you want to hook your Switch up at a friend's house, or vacation home, you don't need to bring your whole dock. However, you will still need some form of adapter. This could be a smaller travel-sized dock, a dongle that connects to the Switch's USB-C port to provide the necessary video and power ports, or even a USB-C to HDMI adapters you already own for your laptop. Just make sure whichever model you choose specifies that it is compatible with Nintendo's Switch.

 
## How do I connect to my Nintendo Switch to my TV wirelessly?  


Unfortunately, there's really no useful way to wirelessly connect your Nintendo Switch to your TV. While you can use a wireless HDMI adapter, you'd still need to connect a wired transmitter dongle to your Switch, which sort of ruins the "wireless" portion of this idea. The Switch also doesn't support built-in casting technologies like Google Cast or Apple's AirPlay. However, you can use your disconnected Joy-Con controllers, or other compatible wireless controllers, wirelessly while your Switch is docked to the TV.
