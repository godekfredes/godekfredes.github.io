Unwanted calls and texts are a major annoyance, especially when you're expecting an important call or message. Luckily, there are several ways to block them on your android device. From built-in features to third-party apps, here are 10 sneaky tricks to block annoying calls and texts on your android – you won't believe #9!

## 1. Use the Built-in Block Feature

Most android devices come with a built-in call and text blocking feature. To activate it, go to your phone's settings, then select "Call" or "Messages," depending on which one you want to block. From there, you can add numbers to your block list or turn on the "Block Unknown Callers" option to block calls from unknown numbers automatically.

## 2. Use Your Carrier's Blocking Feature

Some carriers also offer a blocking feature that you can activate to block unwanted calls and texts. To use this feature, contact your carrier's customer service and ask them to activate it for you. You can then add numbers to your block list using their website or app.

## 3. Install a Third-party Blocking App

There are several third-party apps available on the Google Play Store that can help you block unwanted calls and texts. Some popular ones include Call Blocker, Mr. Number, and Truecaller. These apps use advanced algorithms to detect spammy calls and texts and block them automatically.

## 4. Use Google Voice

Google Voice is a free service that lets you make and receive calls and texts using a different phone number from your actual one. It also comes with a blocking feature that you can use to block unwanted calls and texts from specific numbers.

## 5. Create Custom Contact Groups

Many android devices allow you to create custom contact groups, which can come in handy when blocking unwanted calls and texts. You can create a group called "Spam" or "Telemarketers" and add numbers to it that you want to block.

## 6. Use the "Do Not Disturb" Feature

If you're expecting an important call or message but don't want to be interrupted by unwanted ones, use the "Do Not Disturb" feature. This feature allows you to set specific times when your phone will not ring or vibrate, except for calls and messages from specific contacts.

## 7. Block Calls and Texts from the Dialer

Most android devices allow you to block calls and texts directly from the dialer app. Simply open the app, find the number you want to block, and select "Block Contact" or "Add to Auto-Reject List."

## 8. Use Call Forwarding

If you're receiving a lot of unwanted calls from a specific number, you can use call forwarding to redirect those calls to a different number or voicemail. You can also use call forwarding to send all calls from unknown numbers directly to voicemail.

## 9. Use Tasker

Tasker is an advanced automation app that lets you create custom rules to automate various tasks on your android device. You can use Tasker to create a rule that automatically blocks all calls and texts from unknown numbers or specific contacts.

## 10. Root Your Device

Finally, if you're comfortable with rooting your android device, you can use advanced blocking features that are not available on unrooted devices. For example, you can block calls and texts based on the caller's location or the time of day using apps like Xposed and Gravity Box.

In conclusion, there are several sneaky tricks you can use to block annoying calls and texts on your android device. From simple built-in features to advanced third-party apps and automated rules, there's a solution for every type of user. So go ahead and try these tricks out – you won't believe how much easier your life will become!
