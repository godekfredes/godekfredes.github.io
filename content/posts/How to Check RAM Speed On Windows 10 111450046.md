Introduction
Have you ever wondered how to check your PC's RAM speed? Knowing your RAM speed is crucial when it comes to maximizing your computer's performance. RAM determines how fast your computer processes information, which means that you need to understand how it works if you want to optimize your system for optimal performance. If you are a Windows 10 or 11 user, there is an easy way to check your RAM speed. In this article, we will be discussing how to check RAM speed on Windows 10 and 11.

What is RAM?
Before we dive into how to check RAM speed, it is essential first to understand what RAM is. RAM stands for "Random Access Memory," and it is the short-term memory of your computer. Whenever your computer is running, it stores all the current tasks and programs that you are using in RAM. The higher your RAM, the faster your computer performs tasks, multitasks, and runs programs. In essence, RAM is the glue that keeps all program data together.

What is RAM speed, and why does it matter?
RAM speed is your computer's memory frequency, which means that a higher RAM frequency equates to faster data processing. The typical standard RAM clock speed is 2133 MHz/DDR4-2133, and you'll typically find that most modern computers are rated at around 2400 MHz, but some can go as high as 4000 MHz. Knowing your RAM's speed is crucial as it can significantly impact your computer's performance. If you are a gamer or a streamer, then a high-speed memory frequency will enhance your overall gameplay experience or content creation.

How to Check RAM Speed on Windows 10 and 11:
Now it's time to learn how to check your RAM speed on Windows 10 or 11. Here are the steps you need to follow:

Step 1: Click the "Start" button at the bottom-left of your screen and type "Task Manager."

Step 2: Click on the "Memory" tab.

Step 3: Under "Speed," you will be able to see your RAM's current speed.

Congratulations, you now know how to check your RAM speed on Windows 10 or 11!

Conclusion
RAM is an essential part of your computer that is responsible for the speed and efficiency of your system. Knowing your RAM speed on Windows 10 or 11 is crucial in maximizing your computer's performance. By following the simple steps above, you can quickly determine your RAM speed and make changes if necessary. Be sure to check your RAM frequently, as it is a key factor in ensuring that your computer runs fast and efficiently!

If we talk about the RAM, the 8GB of RAM is usually sufficient for regular gaming and multitasking. However, do you know that RAM speed also decides the overall performance of your computer?
While purchasing a new RAM for a PC, you might have seen a large number followed by MHz (Megahertz) like DDR4 8GB 2400Mhz RAM, or DDR4 4GB 3200Mhz RAM. The 2400Mhz/3200Mhz is the RAM speed here. RAM speed is measured in Mhz, and more MHz means more data transfer speed.
For example, a 2400Mhz RAM means it can perform 2.4 billion clock cycles per second. So, in short and simple words, more Mhz means more data transfer speed. However, the only thing to note here is that you have to make sure that the processor also supports the frequency.

 
### Things to Note before Purchasing/Installing RAM


Let’s say you already have 4GB 2400 Mhz RAM installed in your PC, and you want to upgrade it to 8GB. So, if you purchase 4GB 3200Mhz RAM and install it alongside the 2400Mhz RAM, it will not work.
In that case, you would need to purchase 4GB 2400 Mhz RAM, or else your computer won’t turn on. So, before purchasing a new RAM, it’s always best to check the RAM speed.

 
## 3 Methods to Check RAM Speed in Windows 11/10


Now that you are fully aware of RAM speed, you might want to check your RAM speed on Windows 10 or Windows 11. Below, we have shared few best methods to check RAM speed on Windows PC.

 
### 1. Use Task Manager


Well, Task Manager serves as the easiest option to check RAM speed on Windows 10 computers. You need to follow some of the simple steps given below to check RAM speed via Task Manager.
Step 1. First of all, open Windows search and type in ‘Task Manager’. Open the task manager from the list.

 
Step 2. On the Task Manager, click on the ‘Performance‘ tab.

Step 3. On the Performance tab, click on the ‘Memory‘ option.

Step 4. Now on the right pane, check the ‘Speed.’ The number behind the Speed is the actual RAM speed.

That’s it! You are done. This is how you can use Task Manager to check the RAM speed on Windows 10 and Windows 11.

 
### 2. Using Command Prompt


Like the Task Manager, you can even utilize the Windows 10/11 command prompt to check the RAM speed. Follow some of the simple steps given below to check the RAM speed via Command Prompt.
Step 1. First of all, press Windows Key + R button on your keyboard. This will open the RUN dialog box.

Step 2. On the RUN dialog box, enter ‘CMD‘ and hit the enter button.

Step 3. This will open the Command Prompt on your PC. On the Command prompt, enter the following command and hit the Enter button.

Step 4. Command Prompt will now show you the RAM speed.

 
That’s it. You are done. This is how you can check RAM speed in Windows 10/Windows 11 computers.

 
### 3. Check the sticker on your RAM


If for any reason, you are unable to figure out the RAM speed on your Windows PC, or if your PC is not turning on due to some reason, you need to check the RAM.

For that, you would need to open the PC cabinet and check the RAM sticker. Every manufacturer puts a sticker on the RAM to help buyers in purchasing the correct RAM. The sticker will tell you the RAM size, RAM speed, and few other details.
So, this article is all about how to check RAM speed on Windows 10 and Windows 11. I hope this article helped you! Please share it with your friends also. If you have any doubts related to this, let us know in the comment box below.
