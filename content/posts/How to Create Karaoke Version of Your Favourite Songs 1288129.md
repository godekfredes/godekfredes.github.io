# Unleash Your Inner Superstar - Learn How To Create Karaoke Versions of Your Favorite Songs!

Are you tired of singing along to your favorite songs only to have the artist overpower you? Do you want to be the star of your own karaoke party?

Well, now you can! Creating karaoke versions of your favorite songs is easier than you might think, and with a little practice, you can become the life of the party.

First, let's start by understanding what makes a song karaoke-ready. A karaoke song is one where the vocals of the original song have been removed or lowered in volume, allowing the singer to take center stage. This can be done by using a fancy software or by manually changing the volume levels in a music editing program.

One such program is Audacity, a free and user-friendly audio editing software that makes creating karaoke versions a breeze. Here's how to get started:

1. Download and Install Audacity

Visit the Audacity website and download the software. It's available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.

2. Import Your Song

After opening Audacity, go to File > Import and select the song you want to create a karaoke version of.

3. Split the Stereo Track

In the bottom left corner, you'll see a dropdown menu. Click on it and select 'Split Stereo Track.' This will separate the audio into two tracks: the left track (usually the instrumental track) and the right track (usually the vocal track).

4. Mute or Remove Vocals

Select the right track (the vocal track) and go to Effect > Vocal Reduction and Isolation > Vocal Reduction. You can adjust the amount of vocal reduction to your liking. Press 'Preview' to hear what the track will sound like without the vocals.

Alternatively, you can manually remove the vocals by using the 'Eraser' tool or by using the 'Invert' effect. For the best results, experiment with different methods and settings until you find the right one for your song.

5. Export Your Karaoke Version

Once you're satisfied with your karaoke version, export it by going to File > Export. Save the file as a new name (so you don't overwrite the original) and in a format compatible with your karaoke machine.

With your new karaoke version, you're ready to shine! Invite your friends over and show off your skills. You can also upload your karaoke version to social media and share it with the world.

In conclusion, creating karaoke versions of your favorite songs is a fun and easy way to unleash your inner superstar. With a little bit of practice and the right tools, you can be the life of the party and impress your friends with your singing skills. Don't be afraid to get creative and experiment with different methods to find the perfect karaoke version. So what are you waiting for? Let's get singing!

The web utility we will be employing throughout this process is intuitively called “PhonicMind”. It takes an audio file as the input, segregates the vocals with the help of a series of Machine Learning algorithms and yields two outputs — the verbal sections it extracted and the music-only file which you’re looking for.

 
### Create Karaoke Version of Your Favorite Song with PhonicMind


To get started, head over to the PhonicMind website. Click the ‘Try it now’ button. Drag and drop the audio file of size not more than 30MB stored on your computer. There are a bunch of formats supported right now including *.mp3, *.aac, *.wma, and *.flc.
Once it has finished uploading, you will have to wait for a few seconds so that the AI elves can do what they do best. Now, you have a couple of options. You can either preview the results, download a 30-sec trial file and once you are completely satisfied with the quality, download the entire karaoke file by paying $2.

For that, click the ‘Choose a Bundle’ purple button, select the plan, and you are done.[stories-so-far title=”Also Read” post_ids=”67251, 39867, 20639, 20604″] If you intend to use PhonicMind again, I would recommend opting for the premium packages as they significantly bring down the ‘per song’ price. PhonicMind will also preserve your tracks online after you configure an account and thankfully, these can be retrieved at any time without having to have a premium account.
The developers behind PhonicMind mention that this karaoke app is constantly being trained by listening to music at a rate of twenty minutes every second. I did try it with two tracks, and PhonicMind managed to compose accurate results in both the cases. Although, the dearth of a lyrics tracker is quite disappointing since you are eventually going to use the tracks for karaoke. That being said, PhonicMind doesn’t have any comparable competitors yet.
