Unlock the Secret Hack: Change Your Facebook Name Even After Hitting Limit!

Have you ever hit a roadblock while trying to change your Facebook name? Many people hit the limit when it comes to changing their names on Facebook. It can be frustrating for those who want to update their profile with a new name, or maybe they made a mistake while typing their name during their account setup.

Luckily, there's a secret hack that allows you to change your Facebook name, even after hitting the limit!

Here's how you can do it:

Step 1: Create a New Facebook Account

The first step is to create a new Facebook account with the name that you want to change to. Make sure that you have access to your new account and that it's fully set up.

Step 2: Add the Old Account as a Friend

Once you have your new account set up, you can go ahead and send a friend request to your old account. It may take a little while for your old account to accept the friend request.

Step 3: Change Your Old Account's Name

After your old account accepts the friend request, navigate to the About section on your old account's profile. In the name section, you should see an "Edit" button. Click on it and change your name to something different from your new account's name.

Step 4: Wait for 24 Hours

Facebook has a policy that restricts changing your name more than once within a 24-hour period. So, once you have changed your old account's name, you need to wait for at least 24 hours to change it again.

Step 5: Change Your Old Account's Name Again

After the 24 hours have passed, you can go ahead and change your old account's name again. This time, change it to the name that you want to use on Facebook.

Step 6: Change Your New Account's Name

Once you have successfully changed your old account's name to the desired name, you can go ahead and change your new account's name to something else. This will free up the name that you want to use on Facebook.

Step 7: Change Your Old Account's Name for the Last Time

Lastly, navigate back to your old account's profile and change the name to something else. This will free up the name for you to use on your new account.

Voila! You have successfully changed your Facebook name, even after hitting the limit.

In conclusion, the Facebook name change limit can be a roadblock for many people, but there's always a way around it. With this simple hack, you can change your Facebook name to whatever you want, even after reaching the limit. Just follow the steps mentioned above, and you'll be all set to update your Facebook name with ease. Happy name-changing!

## Steps to Change Your Name on Facebook After Limit



Also, make sure that your name can’t include:

 

Titles of any kind (ex: professional, religious, etc.)
Symbols, repeating characters or punctuation, unusual capitalization, and numbers
Words, phrases, or nicknames in the place of a middle name
Offensive or suggestive content of any kind
Characters from multiple languages



As per Facebook rules, the profile name you use should be your real name as it would be listed on your credit card, student ID, govt-issued proof, etc. So I personally suggest everyone keep your Facebook account of a real name without any fonts or special characters.
So if your profile name limit is exceeded and you want to change your Facebook profile name to your real name, click here.

Fill that form, and you have to upload your valid Government-issued Proof – photo ID like a Driver’s License or Passport, etc, and after your upload finishes, finally click the “Send” button.
Any One Proof will be enough in the list of below examples,

 
#### For Examples:
 

Birth certificate
Marriage certificate
Green card, residence permit, or immigration papers
Personal or vehicle insurance card
Official name change paperwork
Non-driver’s government ID (ex. disability, SNAP, or national ID card)
Voter ID card



If you don’t have this, you can submit copies of any 2 other documents that together show your full name, birthday, and picture. Choose Any Two Proofs will be needed in the list of below examples,

 
#### For Examples:
 

Credit card
Utility bill
School or work ID
Library card
Check
Bus card



Before you submit any valid ID proof, try to have a real picture on your Facebook Account because this may help you get your name change fast as facebook staff will consider your Facebook account like a real account.
Before you submit your valid ID, Facebook staff verified it and changed your name within 4-5 days. So I suggest you take a clear picture of your proof by Scanning or capturing it from a good camera or mobile.
