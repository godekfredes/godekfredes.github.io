#You've Been Watching Your Favorite Movies All Wrong! Learn How to Calibrate Your PC Monitor and Enhance Your Viewing Experience Today!

Movies are the perfect escape from reality, and they are an excellent way to unwind and relax. Watching them on your PC monitor has become more comfortable and accessible than ever with streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+. However, many users wonder why their movie viewing experience does not meet their expectations, despite having the latest and greatest hardware. The answer to this question lies in proper monitor calibration.

##What is Monitor Calibration?

Monitor calibration is the process of optimizing your computer monitor's display settings to ensure accurate and consistent colors. Inaccurate settings can lead to a distorted image and affect the quality of the content you are watching. Proper calibration not only enhances image quality, but it also benefits graphic design professionals, photographers, and artists by providing them with an accurate view of colors.

##Why is Monitor Calibration Important for Movie Watching?

When it comes to watching movies, color is an essential factor that can significantly influence your experience. The right color settings can make the picture more vibrant and realistic, while incorrect settings can make it dull and washed-out. Proper calibration ensures that the colors you see on your monitor accurately represent those intended by the director during the production process. This way, you get to enjoy movies as they were meant to be seen.

##How to Calibrate Your Monitor for Movie Watching

Calibrating your monitor for movie watching is a quick and simple process that anyone can do, regardless of experience. Here are the steps to follow:

###Step 1: Adjust Brightness and Contrast

The first step is to adjust brightness and contrast to create the best balance between image brightness and contrast. Setting brightness too high can lead to a washed-out picture, while a low contrast can make the image look flat.

###Step 2: Adjust Color Balance

The next step is to adjust the color balance. This includes adjusting the RGB (red, green, and blue) balance and color temperature. The ideal color temperature is around 6500K, which produces natural-looking colors. You can use an online calibration tool or a calibration device to get precise color balance settings.

###Step 3: Adjust Gamma

The final step is to adjust the gamma, which controls the brightness of mid-tones. By default, most monitors have a gamma of 2.2, which is suitable for general use. However, movie viewers might prefer a gamma of 2.4 or higher for a more cinematic experience.

##So, You've Been Watching Your Favorite Movies All Wrong!

In conclusion, monitor calibration is essential for enhancing your movie watching experience. With the right calibration settings, you can enjoy movies the way they were meant to be seen with accurate colors and vibrant images. Calibration is easy and straightforward, requiring just a few clicks of a button. So what are you waiting for? Give your PC monitor a tune-up and elevate your movie experience to the next level!

They have also come way down in price. You can now pick up a powerful desktop or laptop computer for a fraction of the cost that you would have paid for a lesser machine in the mid-1990s.
Peripheral devices have also made great strides. For example, you can purchase large, flat-screen HD monitors that are extremely lightweight with great picture quality. Many people use these wonderful gadgets to play video games or stream movies. However, if you buy a new monitor, its display settings might not be right for you.
That’s why you need to know how to test and calibrate your PC monitor. Before we tell you how to adjust your monitor’s settings, let’s define them.

 
## What are monitor settings?


When you go to adjust the settings on your monitor, it’s a good idea to know what you are adjusting.

 
Brightness – This setting is pretty self-explanatory. Adjusting this will make your screen brighter or darker, depending on what you like. Many people find that the 75% range is the most comfortable on their eyes. Try this setting with both the room lights on and off to make sure it works for either.Color – When you increase or decrease the color setting, you adjust the color saturation of the monitor. That indicates how bold and deep the colors are. Turn it all the way up and then turn it all the way down to see the color range. Set it where it’s most appealing to you.Sharpness – This setting is dependent on your monitor’s resolution and the quality of what you are watching. An HD movie will look different from a lower-quality video that you would find on YouTube. If sharpness is set too low, it could result in a softer, blurry picture.Tint – This setting adjusts the color hue, defined as the property of light by which the color of an object is classified as red, blue, green or yellow about the spectrum. This can vary depending on the monitor’s manufacturer. Many times this setting will impact the color and dimness of the display.
 
## How to make basic monitor display adjustments


Depending on the ambient lighting at your home, the default display settings on your monitor might not be appropriate. You will need to adjust them manually.
First, go to a website like Netflix or Hulu that offers streaming in HD. You could instead play a Blu-ray Disk if your computer has a built-in Blu-ray player.
Watching an HD movie is the best way to see if the monitor is set up the way you like. If the picture is too bright or dark, you can adjust those settings to your personal taste.
Your monitor should have buttons located on the front that allow you to adjust the screen’s color and brightness. Check the owner’s manual for specific instructions, as these functions differ by brand.
Adjusting display settings with these buttons located on the monitor is the easiest way. There is a more in-depth way to make adjustments. Both Windows computers and macOS already have calibration tools built in. They are quick and easy to use.
Before starting the calibration process, be sure to have your monitor in 24-bit or high-resolution mode. To avoid glaring, use normal room lighting.
