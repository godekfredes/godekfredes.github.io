If you're anything like us, then you're probably tired of seeing all the Pokemon Go spam clogging up your Facebook feed. It seems like every other post is about someone catching a rare Pokemon or taking over a gym. While we love the game as much as the next person, we don't want it taking over our social media feeds. Fortunately, Facebook has introduced a solution that allows users to block all mentions of the game.

##Step 1: Visit Your News Feed Preferences

First, you'll need to visit your News Feed Preferences. To do this, click on the arrow in the top right corner of your Facebook homepage and select "News Feed Preferences" from the dropdown menu.

##Step 2: Select "Hide Topics"

Once you're on the News Feed Preferences page, select "Hide Topics" from the menu at the top. This will allow you to filter out posts that mention specific topics.

##Step 3: Type in "Pokemon Go"

Now, type in "Pokemon Go" in the search bar and select it from the dropdown menu. This will bring up a list of all the posts on your feed that contain the phrase "Pokemon Go".

##Step 4: Hit "Done"

Once you've selected "Pokemon Go", hit "Done" and you're all set! Facebook will now filter out all mentions of the game on your News Feed.

##Additional Tips

If you're still seeing Pokemon Go posts, try the following additional tips:

- Unfollow or unfriend accounts that are posting too much about the game
- Use keywords in the "Hide Topics" search bar to filter out related phrases, such as "Pikachu" or "Gym battles"
- Take a break from Facebook altogether and enjoy the game outside in the real world
