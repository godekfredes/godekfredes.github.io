## Create Virus Using Notepad


Many of you will think the methods must be on coding, but nothing like that. The tricks are based on Notepad. Just follow the below steps for creating a harmless virus using a notepad. Additionally, you can remove malware from your browser if it is infected.

 
### 1) Creating a Dangerous Virus


1. First of all, in your Windows OS, open Notepad.

2. Copy and paste the code below into your notepad screen.

3. Save this file as virus.bat (you can select any random name, but .bat must be there after that).

Now running the file will delete the C drive completely, and the operating system of the respective computer will get corrupted.
Note: This method is only for knowledge purposes. Don’t try this on your computer, as it will completely format your C drive.

 
### 2) Creating a Harmless Cdrom Virus

When you double-click on this file, you will be amazed at what this simple, harmless virus can do. Your CD/DVD drives will get continuously ejected.

### 3) Create a Virus To Test Your Antivirus (fake virus notepad)


Open Notepad and paste the given code and save the file as “EICAR.COM”

If you have an active antivirus, your antivirus program will remove this file in no time. This is the harmless virus used to check your antivirus’s security level.

 
### 4) Virus To Stop Someone’s Internet Access


This is a harmless virus, and it will not destroy your PC. You can use this notepad virus script to prank your friends. This virus stops anyone’s internet access. You need to type the following code in Notepad.

Save the file in a .bat format like internet.bat and send it to your friends. The IP address will be lost, so they won’t be able to fix it. Well, if you want to fix it. Type in IPconfig /renew. So, this is one of the best notepad virus pranks.

 
### 5) Creating a Matrix Type screen


Well, it’s not a virus. It is just a simple notepad trick that will let you see the string of green characters appearing randomly. It has nothing to do with your computer registry, batch, etc. However, you can use this trick to scare your friend because the screen looks like a virus is affected.
Open Notepad and type the following code into it.

Now save the file as Matrix.bat, click on it, and the show begins.

 
### 6) Shutdown virus


You can also create a virus that can shut down computers. This virus is harmless but can cause data loss due to a sudden shutdown. Here’s how you can make a shutdown virus to pull up a prank with your friends.
1. First of all, right-click on your desktop and then choose the option Create Shortcut.

2. In the pop-up window, type in shutdown -s -t 60 -c “Virus Detection. The computer is shutting down.” Instead of 60, you can put what value you want. It represents the time in seconds.

3. Then click on the Next button and type chrome. Or whatever you want.

4. Then, you need to change the Shortcut icon and choose the icon of Google Chrome.

Your virus will look like Google Chrome. You can carry this file in your Pendrive and shut down your friends’ computers.
