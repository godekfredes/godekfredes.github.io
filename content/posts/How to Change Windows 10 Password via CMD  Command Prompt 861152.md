# The Secret Windows 10 Password Hack You Need to Know - Learn How to Change It Via CMD!

As a Windows 10 user, you might find yourself forgetting your login password from time to time. This can be frustrating, especially if you have important files or data on your computer. While there are various ways to reset a forgotten password, one lesser-known method involves using the command prompt (CMD) to change it. In this article, we’ll explore this secret Windows 10 password hack and show you how to change your login password using CMD.

## What is CMD?

CMD or Command Prompt is a command-line interface available in Windows operating systems. It allows users to navigate through the computer’s file system and execute commands. CMD can be accessed by typing “cmd” into the Windows search bar and then hitting enter. Once open, it presents a black command-line interface where you can enter commands.

## Why Use CMD to Change Password?

While there are other ways to change your password, using CMD is a quick and simple method. Additionally, it’s ideal for tech-savvy users who are comfortable using command-line interfaces. However, it’s essential to note that changing your password using CMD does not work if you’re logged in as a standard user. You must have administrator privileges to make any changes.

## How to Change Your Password Using CMD

Now that you understand what CMD is and why you should use it let's get into how to change your password using CMD:

Step 1: Open CMD

Open CMD by typing “cmd” in the search bar or pressing the Windows key + R on your keyboard and then typing “cmd” and pressing enter.

Step 2: Access the Command Prompt with Admin Privileges

Right-click on the Command Prompt icon and select “Run as administrator.”

Step 3: Change the Password

Once you’re in the Command Prompt with admin privileges, type the following command: 

` net user *username* *newpassword*`

Replace *username* with your account username and *newpassword* with your desired password. 

For example, if your account username is “John” and your new password is “12345678,” the command will look like this:

` net user John 12345678`

Step 4: Confirm Changes

After entering the command, you’ll see a confirmation message that the command was executed successfully. Restart your computer, and then log in using your new password.

## Conclusion

Changing your password via CMD is a fast and effective way to reset your login credentials on your Windows 10 PC. However, keep in mind that this method requires administrator privileges and is not suitable for beginners or users who are not comfortable using CMD. If you're not sure how to use command-line interfaces or feel uncomfortable doing so, it’s best to use another method or seek assistance from a professional. 

With that said, understanding the Windows 10 password hack using CMD can be useful in case of an emergency, and you need to reset your password quickly. Use this information with caution and only when necessary.

While installing Windows 10, Microsoft asks users to create a local account. The local account is protected with a password, and users can change the password later via the Settings page. If you suspect that someone has your Windows 10 password, it’s safer to change it.
