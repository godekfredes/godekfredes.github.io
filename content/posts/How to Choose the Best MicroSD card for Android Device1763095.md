# 5 Insider Tips to Find the Perfect MicroSD Card for Your Android - #4 Will Surprise You!

Are you tired of running out of storage space on your Android phone? A microSD card can be an excellent storage expansion solution for many Android users. But, the market is flooded with a variety of microSD cards to choose from, and it can be daunting to know which one is perfect for your device. Here are five insider tips to find the best microSD card for your Android phone.

## 1. Look for Class Ratings

There are various classes of microSD cards available in the market, from Class 2 to Class 10. The Class rating determines how fast the data can be transferred in the card. For instance, a Class 2 card can transfer data at a speed of 2 MB/s, while a Class 10 card can transfer data to a speed of 10 MB/s. Consider buying a Class 10 card for quick transfer speeds that can match the performance of your Android phone.

## 2. Consider Storage Capacity

When it comes to microSD cards, the storage capacity varies widely from 4GB to a whopping 1TB. To choose the right storage capacity, consider your usage patterns. If you use your Android phone primarily for browsing and social media, a 32GB or 64GB microSD card will suffice. However, if you prefer to store videos and pictures on your phone, go for a higher storage option.

## 3. Check for UHS Speed Ratings

The Ultra High-Speed (UHS) Class is a newer class rating system that determines how quickly data can be written on the card. UHS-I cards can write data at a speed of 104 MB/s, while UHS-II cards can write data at a speed of 312 MB/s. If your phone supports UHS-II, consider buying a card with such a rating.

## 4. Look for Endurance Ratings

MicroSD cards can handle a specific number of write cycles. Manufacturers usually indicate write cycle limits with endurance ratings. A higher endurance rating is ideal if you intend to store data regularly on your microSD card. Ensure you look for microSD cards that can handle the number of write cycles you need.

## 5. Choose the Right Brand

Choose reputable brands such as SanDisk, Samsung, Kingston, or Lexar when buying a microSD card. These brands are known for their quality and performance.

In conclusion, finding the perfect microSD card for your Android phone can be challenging, but considering the tips mentioned above can help make the process easier. Consider the class ratings, storage capacity, UHS speed ratings, endurance ratings, and reliable brands. With these, you will be on your way to finding the perfect microSD card to cater to your Android phone storage needs.
