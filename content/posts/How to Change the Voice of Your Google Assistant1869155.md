Transform Your Google Assistant into A Celebrity Voice with This Simple Hack!

If you've ever wanted to converse with a celebrity or have them answer your queries as your phone's virtual assistant, you're in luck! Google Assistant now features celebrity voices, and it's as simple as giving some voice commands to your device.

For non-geniuses, this seems like a daunting task. How can a person with no technical ability convert their Google Assistant to a celebrity voice? But fear not because we're here to help. In this article, we'll walk you through the steps you need to follow to make that happen!

Step 1: Open the Google Assistant app

Launch the Google Assistant app from your Android or iOS device. Alternatively, you can summon it by saying, "Hey Google" or holding down your smartphone's Home button.

Step 2: Access the Google Assistant Settings

On the app's homepage, tap on the compass icon, which represents the 'Explore' icon. This will lead to a vertical menu. On the menu, tap on the profile icon situated on the right corner of the screen.

Step 3: Access the Settings

Now, the setup is done, and you can discover the Voice Search area by clicking on "Settings." Afterward, select 'Assistant.' Within that tab, you'll see the alternative to add a 'Voice' section.

Step 4: Choose the celebrity voice of your preference

Here's the best part. Google now carries a range of celebrity voices from which you can select. If you'd like to communicate with John Legend, just pick his voice option from the menu. You can repeat the same process for several other celebrities, including Issa Rae and many more.

Step 5: Save and test

Once you've selected the voice of your preference, tap save. Now, return to the Google Assistant homepage and test your new celebrity voice. Say "Hey Google" and your preferred celebrity voice will respond instead of Google Assistant's automated voice.

In conclusion, with a few taps, you can now have John Legend's voice, Issa Rae's voice, or any other celebrity's voice delivering your Google Assistant's answers. Although it may feel like an insignificant alteration, customizing your Google Assistant voice can bring a whole new experience to the dynamic between you and Google. Give it a shot! You'll never know how enjoyable it feels until you try.
