In this article, we will guide you through the step-by-step process of changing the color schemes and fonts on your Windows terminal, so you can give it a personalized look that suits you.

Before we begin, there are a few things that you need to know. First, the process involves using a command-line tool called PowerShell, so you need to have it installed on your Windows computer.

Step 3: Choose a color scheme

In the Settings menu, you will see a list of different color schemes to choose from. Click on the one that you like the best, and you will see a preview of how it looks on the right side of the screen. If you don't see any color schemes that you like, you can create your own by clicking on the Add button at the bottom of the list and entering the values for each color.

Step 4: Change the font

Next, click on the tab labeled "Appearance" to change the font. You will see a list of all the available fonts that you can use in your terminal. Select the one that you like the best, and you will see a preview of how it looks on the right side of the screen.
