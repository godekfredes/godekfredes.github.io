Title: How One Simple Step Can Keep Your Loved One Safe and Secure – The Ultimate Guide to Choosing the Right Medical Alert System

Are you worried about a loved one living alone or someone who has health issues? Do you want peace of mind while they are at home or out and about? It is essential to explore the benefits of medical alert systems. They can provide your loved one with the assistance they need in case of an emergency. Here's the ultimate guide to choosing the right medical alert system.

What is a Medical Alert System?

A medical alert system is a device that helps seniors, disabled individuals, and those with health issues stay safe and secure in case of an emergency. The device connects to a communication center, which dispatches emergency services when needed. There are two types of medical alert systems, traditional and mobile.

Traditional medical alert systems comprise of a base station and a pendant or wristband. They usually work within a specific range and connect to a landline. Mobile medical alert systems are more advanced and use cellular networks to connect the user to the call center. They come with GPS tracking features, making it easier for emergency services to locate the person in need.

Choosing The Right Medical Alert System

1. Evaluate Your Loved One's Needs

Before choosing a medical alert system, consider your loved one's needs. Do they need a system that tracks their location, or are they only concerned with getting help in case of an emergency? Do they prefer a traditional or mobile system?

2. Look For A Reliable Company

Look for a company that has a reputation for providing quality services. Read reviews and check for certifications, such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL) certification, which ensures that the device is reliable.

3. Consider The Cost

Cost is a critical factor in choosing a medical alert system. Traditional systems are often less expensive than mobile systems. However, mobile systems are more convenient as they provide more features such as GPS tracking.

4. Understand The Features

Medical alert systems come with different features. Some have automatic fall detection, while others require manual activation. Some come with additional services, such as medication reminders or caregiver check-ins.

5. Test The Device

Before purchasing a medical alert system, test it to ensure that it works for your loved one. Check the range and battery life, and ensure that the call center provides quality services.

Conclusion

Choosing the right medical alert system is crucial for the safety and security of your loved one. Evaluate your loved one's needs, look for a reliable company, consider the cost and understand the features before purchasing a device. With the right medical alert system, you can have peace of mind knowing that your loved one is safe and secure in case of an emergency.

According to NCOA, an older adult is treated in the emergency room for a fall every 11 seconds. Every 19 minutes, an older adult dies from a fall. Falls are the leading cause of fatal injury among older adults as well.
The best way to handle that concern is to help your loved one find a balance between independence and safety. A medical alert system will help. And it will give you the peace of mind you need. So, if you’re concerned about an aging loved one, it’s time to invest in this type of system. Here’s why.

 
## Medical alert systems: What they are and how they work


If you have a loved one who’s getting older, you may be looking for a way to help them maintain their independence while ensuring they’re safe. That can be tough to do, but a medical alert system can help. 
You know those old, “Help! I’ve fallen, and I can’t get up!” commercials? They were advertising a medical alert system. They’re systems that monitor your loved one while at home or out and about. If a medical emergency triggers the system, it’s used to summon help via operators on the other end, who can call either an ambulance or a loved one. 
A medical alert system will most of the time consist of a wearable pendant and a base station that connects to a phone line. The pendant is pressed if there’s an emergency or a fall and your loved one needs help. Calls to monitoring agents are placed through the connected phone line. 
These systems can also be used to monitor for falls or other accidents. Most systems offer additional fall detection and GPS tracking on top of basic services to ensure your loved one is covered no matter where they are.
You aren’t limited to just a pendant system, either; there are tons of different options out there. Some offer mobile device integration or even smartwatches that can help keep your loved one safe. Newer devices may even be able to monitor your loved one’s vitals and call for help if there’s a health emergency on the horizon.
But with so many options, how can you choose? We’re breaking it down for you below.

 
## Life Alert


Life Alert is one of the most popular medical alert systems on the market, and so is the trusted service you’ll get with it. Contract and activation fees aren’t great, though. 
It also doesn’t offer fall detection, which could be a deal-breaker if you’re concerned about slips and falls. This system won’t detect a fall that knocks them unconscious or renders them unable to summon help via the button. That’s important to keep in mind if you’re concerned about those types of accidents.

 
Activation fee: $0 to $95Monthly costs: $49 for in-home landline service; $49 for in-home cellular service; $19 for mobile GPS trackingFall detection: Not offeredContract required: Yes, 36 months. Void if there are extenuating circumstances (managed care, death, etc.)Cancellation fee: Varies
 
## GreatCall Lively Mobile Plus


If you’re looking for a medical alert system that offers fall detection and in-home monitoring at an affordable price, you may want to check out GreatCall Lively Mobile Plus. This wearable alert system offers all of those services at a price that’s well below some of the competition, and the activation fee is pretty low, too. 
You won’t have to sign up for an ongoing contract, either. This home alert service doesn’t offer landline in-home monitoring, though. If your loved one only has a landline, this plan isn’t the best option. 

 
Activation fee: $25 to $35Monthly costs: $25 to $50 for in-home cellular service; $25 to $50 for the mobile GPS tracking serviceFall detection: Yes; $15 extra per monthContract required: No contractsCancellation fee: None
 
## Bay Alarm Medical


Bay Alarm Medical offers all of the monitoring services you could want in a medical alert system: in-home landline service, in-home cellular service, GPS mobile tracking, and fall detection. 
The downside to this option is that the mobile unit battery life has pretty short battery life. It only lasts for four days without needing a recharge. If you’re buying this for a patient with memory issues, they may struggle to remember to charge the unit. That could leave them in a lurch while out and about.

## Life Station


Life Station offers everything you’d need for comprehensive monitoring. It has fall detection, in-home cellular and landline services, and GPS mobile tracking. However, the monthly cost for GPS mobile tracking is expensive compared to other options. Whether that’s enough to make you opt-out of Life Station is up to you, but it is something to consider.

 
Activation fee: NoneMonthly costs: $22 for in-home landline service; $31 for in-home cellular service; $38 for GPS mobile trackingFall detection: Yes; $10 extra per monthContract required: No contractsCancellation fee: None
 
## Medical Alert


Medical Alert offers several different wearable options to help keep your loved ones safe. It also offers comprehensive options, including fall detection. GPS tracking costs on this one are pretty steep, though. The mobile unit battery life is pretty low on this option, too.

## Medical Guardian


If you’re looking for top-notch medical alert monitoring devices, Medical Guardian offers them. The wearable alert systems are easily hidden when out and about, which could be a relief for your loved one — no bulky pendants to contend with.
