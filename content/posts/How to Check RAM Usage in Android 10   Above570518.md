Are you wondering why your Android device is slowing down or behaving erratically? It could be due to resource-hogging apps or processes drawing too much RAM. But how do you find out which apps are affecting your device's performance? Do not worry. In this article, we will show you a simple trick to help you monitor your Android's RAM usage and identify the apps that are consuming most of your device's memory.

Before we dive into the trick itself, let's briefly explain what RAM is and why it matters for your device's performance. RAM or Random Access Memory is a type of volatile memory that your phone uses to store data temporarily. Any time you launch an app or perform a task, your device uses RAM to hold the relevant data and execute the commands.

If your phone's RAM is limited, your device will struggle to load and run apps, causing lags, freezes, or even crashes. That's why it is crucial to keep an eye on your device's RAM usage and prevent any app or process from consuming too much RAM.

To check your Android's RAM usage, you need to follow these simple steps:

Step 1: Access the "Developer Options" menu

Before you can check your device's RAM usage, you need to enable the "Developer Options" menu on your Android device. To do that, go to your device's "Settings" menu and scroll down to "About Phone" (or "About Device"). Tap on "Software Information," then tap "Build number" seven times until you get a message that says, "You are now a developer."

Step 2: Open the "Developer Options" menu

After enabling the "Developer Options" menu, go back to the "Settings" menu, and you should see a new option called "Developer Options." Tap on it to access the menu.

Step 3: Check your device's RAM usage

In the "Developer Options" menu, scroll down to the "Monitoring" section and tap on "Memory." Here, you can see your device's current RAM usage, including the total amount of RAM, used RAM, free RAM, and the percentage of RAM used. You can also see a breakdown of the RAM usage by apps or processes, sorted in descending order of RAM consumption.

By checking your device's RAM usage regularly or after installing new apps, you can identify the apps or processes that are consuming too much RAM and causing your device to slow down or crash. You can then take appropriate actions, such as clearing the app's cache or data, force stopping the app, or uninstalling it if necessary.

In conclusion, checking your Android's RAM usage is a simple yet effective trick to maintain your device's performance and prevent any unwanted behavior. By following the steps above, you can access your device's developer options menu and monitor your RAM usage at any time. Additionally, you can use third-party apps or tools to automate the process and get more detailed insights into your device's performance. So, unlock the secrets of your Android, and keep your device running smoothly!

While Android does provide you with a recent apps screen that shows your available RAM, there is no way to check which apps are using how much memory.
So, if you are using an older version of Android, you need to utilize third-party apps to know the RAM consumption of Apps. However, if you are using Android 10, you can view the app’s RAM usage without installing any third-party app.
