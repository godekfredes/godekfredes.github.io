Although the feature is useful, it’s a little bit complicated to set up. First, you need to have a wireless network card with Hosted Network support. Follow some of the simple methods shared below to turn your Windows 10 into a wireless hotspot.

 
### Check if Wireless Adapter Supports Hosted Networks


Although most of the modern wireless adapters support hosted networks, you still need to verify your PC’s physical wireless adapter supports this feature or not. For that, you need to execute the following command –
NETSH WLAN show drivers

On the Command Prompt Window, you need to check the ‘Hosted Network Supported’ listing.

 
### Create WiFi Hotspot In Windows 10


NOTE: Before you begin, you should ensure that you’ve got a laptop or desktop with a wireless card. Additionally, the wireless card should be free.
Step 1. First, you need to open the command prompt with administrator privileges. Press the Windows + X key on your keyboard and select Command Prompt (Admin) from the pop-up menu.
Step 2. Now we will create the hotspot. Enter the following command and press the Enter key:
netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid=techviral key=password

Step 3. The SSID is the name of the WiFi connection. The KEY is the password. You need to replace the SSID and Key as per your wish.
Step 4. Next, you need to start the following command to start the WiFi hotspot:
netsh wlan start hostednetwork

Step 5. Your WiFi hotspot should be activated and usable. You can check its status in the network and sharing center of your control panel.

Step 6. You can now connect your devices to the hotspot and use the same WiFi connection without third-party tools.
Step 7. You can turn off the hotspot when not in use with the following command:
netsh wlan stop hostednetwork

Important: Not every wireless card supports Hosted Network. Sometimes, outdated wireless cards result in errors message.
