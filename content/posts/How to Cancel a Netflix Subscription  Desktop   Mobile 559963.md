If you’ve subscribed to a Netflix monthly plan, it may be difficult for you to figure out how to cancel it at the end of the month. Being the most popular video streaming service, Netflix offers you an option to cancel the subscription anytime.
If you cancel your Netflix streaming plan with time left in your billing period, you can use Netflix until the end of the billing period. Once the billing period ends, you won’t be able to watch any content on Netflix.
So, if you want to take a break from Netflix and want to try out some other options, you need to cancel the Netflix subscription before the billing period. Or else, Netflix will use your payment methods to charge you another month.
