# Stop Struggling to Find the Best Sound Bar! Learn How to Save Money and Get the Perfect Fit for Your Home Entertainment System Now!

Are you tired of struggling to find the perfect sound bar for your home entertainment system? Do you want to save money while getting the best possible sound quality? Look no further! In this article, we will share some tips and tricks on how to choose the best sound bar for your needs and budget.

## Determine Your Budget

Before you start shopping for a sound bar, you need to determine how much you are willing to spend. Sound bars can range from under $100 to over $1000, depending on the features and quality you are looking for. It's crucial to set a budget to narrow down your options and avoid overspending.

## Assess Your Room Size

The size of your room plays a critical role in determining the power and size of the soundbar you need. A small room will typically require a sound bar with lower wattage, while larger rooms will need a more powerful one. You may also need to consider the shape of your room and the placement of windows, doors, and furniture.

## Evaluate Sound Quality

When it comes to sound quality, there are different factors you need to consider. Check the Dolby Atmos or DTS:X for the best experience, and you can’t go wrong with a high-end soundbar. If you're more of a casual listener, then you can settle for a mid-range sound bar that will give you good enough sound quality at a decent price.

## Don't Forget Connectivity

It's essential to check the connectivity of the sound bar before making your final decision. Look for a model that's compatible with your TV, gaming console, or other devices. If you're interested in smart home integration, consider a sound bar that has built-in Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or voice assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant.

## Shop Around and Compare Prices

Once you have determined your budget and requirements, start shopping around to find the best deals. Check online retailers or visit physical stores to test different models and compare prices. Don't forget to read reviews from other customers to learn about the pros and cons of each soundbar.

## Final Words

Choosing the best sound bar for your home entertainment system doesn't have to be a daunting task. By considering your budget, room size, sound quality, connectivity, and shopping around, you can find the perfect fit for your needs and budget. Remember, a good sound bar can enhance your movie, gaming, or music experience, so invest wisely, and enjoy your new sound system!

However, as manufacturers continue perfecting their flatscreen production techniques, TVs are also continuously getting slimmer and thinner. While aesthetically speaking, these form factor advancements are always welcome, thinner TVs mean smaller speakers and worse sound.
Fortunately, there are modern ways to enhance your flatscreen’s sound without the need for complicated set-ups and equipment. For most common households, the best way to boost your TV’s sound is via a sound bar.
Here are the various types of sound bars you can currently get and tips on how to choose the best one for you:

 
## Form factors
 
### Sound Bar


The sound bar is the most common form factor for external TV speakers these days. Like its name suggests, it is shaped like a long, thin bar that can be wall mounted or positioned on top of a table below the TV.
Sound bars typically house two or three speakers and popular models now come with a separate sub-woofer for enhanced bass. For most homes, the sound bar form factor is a good choice. The tricky part is positioning it properly for optimum sound without blocking your TV’s front sensors.

 
### Sound Base


If you don’t want to mount your TV but you’d still prefer a clean look, you can opt for a sound base instead. With their boxy and flat form factors, these are essentially stands or pedestals for your TV. This speaker setup eliminates positioning problems and potential TV sensor obstruction.
Sound bases are often integrated with multiple speakers and a sub-woofer too, making them perfect all-in-one solutions if you have limited space.

 
## Number of Channels


You’ve probably noticed these decimal numbers (2.1, 5.1, 7.1, etc.) while shopping for your next sound system.  They may look like earthquake magnitudes but nope, these don’t indicate how intense or loud they can go.
These numbers actually represent the number of channels a speaker system has. For example, 2.1 means it has two front speaker channels and the number after the decimal point (.1) represents the sub-woofer. A 5.1 system, on the other hand, will have 6 speakers – left, right, center, left surround, right surround plus a sub-woofer.
A 5.1 system, on the other hand, will have six speakers – left, right, center, left surround, right surround plus a sub-woofer.
If all you want is better TV sound for your living room or bedroom, a simple 2.1 system may suffice. However, if you ‘re looking for a more immersive and cinematic sound, shoot for at least a 3.1 system with virtual surround sound or better yet, a 5.1 system.

 
## Connections


The most popular connection option for TV sound bars is digital optical. Make sure the model you’re getting has this.
Most flatscreen TVs have at least one digital optical output (it’s easy to spot – it emits a red laser light). With this connection, you can hook up multiple types of gear to your TV via HDMI and the single cable will handle the switching for you.
If your TV supports digital pass-through, an optical connection will even deliver true multi-speaker surround sound formats like 5.1.
More expensive sound bars have multiple HDMI inputs and connect to your TV via single HDMI cable instead. With this setup, the sound bar will act as your input switcher instead of the TV. You’ll also want a sound bar with Bluetooth connectivity so you can stream music from your smartphone wirelessly.
