# Rev Up Your Messaging Game with These Epic Word Effects - Learn How Now!

Are you tired of sending boring, flat messages to people? Do you want to impress your friends with unique and epic messaging that stands out from the crowd? Well, you're in luck! There's a plethora of word effects that you can use to make your messaging game top-notch. Here are a few examples that will blow your mind and dazzle your recipients:

## Bold, Italic and Underline

The good old-fashioned bold, italic and underlining still work wonders in getting your message to stand out. Want to emphasize a point? Use the bold or underlining option. Want to show excitement? Use italics. Just make sure to use them sparingly, as overusing them can make your message come off as obnoxious.

## CAPS LOCK

Do you want to express your message with intensity and emotion? Use CAPS LOCK! This key is often abused, but when used correctly, it can communicate a message in a way that only CAPITAL LETTERS can. Just be careful not to overdo it, as overuse of ALL CAPS is equivalent to yelling.

## Emojis

Emojis are a fun way to convey emotion, and they don't require any words. Trollfaces, poop-emojis, and heart-eyes are just a few examples of the kinds of emojis available. An emoji can add a personal touch to your message, and can make it memorable.

## Parentheses

Parentheses can convey a secret message, a thought or a comment that is separate from the rest of the text, such as (whispering) or (just saying). They can also be used to add a touch of humor to your message.

## Strikethrough

The strikethrough can be an effective way to correct a mistake or simply to add a twist of originality to your message. It can also convey the fact that you're joking, which can help to avoid misunderstandings.

## Color

Different words and phrases can be highlighted with different colors to create a fun, eye-catching effect. Just make sure to choose the right color, as colors can evoke different emotions and can convey different connotations.

## Abbreviations

Abbreviations, acronyms and slang can be used to convey the same message in fewer words, which can be useful when you are limited to a certain character count. Familiar abbreviations like LOL, TTYL or WTF are common, but ones specific to your interests and area can also be used to bond with your recipient.

As you can see, there are plenty of ways to take your messaging skills to epic heights. Rev up your messaging game today by trying out these word effects and see how they can make a difference in your messaging habits. Happy messaging!

This article will discuss Word Effects and how you can use it on Facebook Messenger. Word Effects is designed to improve your messaging experience by adding certain visual elements. The visual elements of the feature will certainly make your conversations more fun & exciting.

 
### What are Word Effects in Messenger?


In short and simple words, Word Effects is a set of words/phrases which, if used in a conversation, will initiate emoji animations that will flow all over the screen. If you send word effects on a chat in Messenger, the accompanying emoji animation will float all over the screen.
However, the only take here is that the chat where you will be using Word Effects should have applied a theme. If the conversation has a default messenger theme, the word effects won’t play.
Messenger even allows you to create your word effects with your emojis. After creating a word effect, you need to type & send the word/phrase to fill both chat screens with animations of emojis.

 
## How to Use Word Effects in Messenger?


Well, it’s pretty easy to use Word Effects in Facebook Messenger, but you need to use the mobile app. The functionality isn’t available on computers. Here’s how to use Word Effects in Messenger.
1. First, open the chat where you want to use word effects and change the Messenger theme.
2. Once changed, tap on the contact’s name at the top.

3. On the profile page for the other person, scroll down and tap on the Word effects.

4. On the Word effects screen, you will see all available word effects. You need to take a note of the phrases and emojis.

5. After taking the note, open the chat again and send the exact phrase as a text.

That’s it! This will fill your screen with emojis floating from the bottom to the top.

 
### How to Create Custom Word Effects on Messenger?


As mentioned above, Messenger even allows you to create custom word effects for chats. Here’s how to create custom word effects on Messenger.
1. First, open the Messenger chat with a theme applied.
2. Tap on the contact’s name at the top.

3. On the profile page for the other person, scroll down and tap on the Word effects.

4. On the Word effects screen, tap on the bottom text box and add your desired phrases.

6. Next, select the emoji you want to add to the word/phrase. Once done, tap on the Done button.

7. Now, open the chat again and send the word you have set.

This is how you can add custom word effects to Messenger.
So, that’s all about using Word effects in the Messenger app for Android & iOS. The Word effects are an exciting feature, but it has some limitations. You can’t trigger multiple word effects with a single text, and you can only add a total of 50 custom phrases as word effects.
