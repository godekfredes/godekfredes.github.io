# Unlock the Secret Power of Your Pixel 6: Charge ALL Your Devices Using Battery Share!

The Google Pixel 6 is a powerful device that offers a range of features and benefits to its users. One of the most innovative features of this device is its Battery Share functionality, which allows users to charge all their other devices, including phones, tablets, and headphones, using their Pixel 6.

In this article, we will discuss how to unlock the secret power of your Pixel 6 and charge all your devices using the Battery Share function.

## Understanding Battery Share

Before we dive into the details of Battery Share, let's first understand the concept of charging your devices using your Pixel 6.

Battery Share is a feature that allows your Pixel 6 to act as a charging hub for all your other compatible devices. Essentially, you can use the battery of your Pixel 6 to charge up other devices using a wired or wireless charging method. This feature is extremely useful when you're traveling or don't have access to an outlet.

## Setting Up Battery Share

To use Battery Share, you must first enable this feature on your Pixel 6. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Swipe down from the top of your screen to access the Quick Settings panel.
2. Tap on the battery icon.
3. From the options that appear, tap on Battery Share.
4. Toggle the switch to turn on Battery Share.

Once you've enabled this feature on your Pixel 6, it's time to start charging your other devices.

## Charging Your Other Devices

There are two ways to charge your other devices using Battery Share:

### Wired Charging

For wired charging, you'll need a USB-C to USB-C cable to connect your Pixel 6 to the device you want to charge. Follow these steps:

1. Plug in one end of the USB-C cable to your Pixel 6 and the other end to the device you want to charge.
2. Your Pixel 6 will automatically detect the device and start charging it. You'll see a notification on your screen when charging starts.

### Wireless Charging

For wireless charging, you'll need a Qi wireless charging-compatible device to charge using Battery Share. Follow these steps:

1. Place your Qi-compatible device on the back of your Pixel 6.
2. Your Pixel 6 will automatically detect the device and start charging it. You'll see a notification on your screen when charging starts.

## Conclusion

The Battery Share feature of the Pixel 6 is a game-changer for anyone who travels frequently or has multiple devices that need charging. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can unlock the full potential of your Pixel 6 and start charging all your other devices using your phone's battery.

With Battery Share, you'll never have to worry about running out of battery on your other devices again. So go ahead, give it a try and experience the convenience of charging all your devices using your Pixel 6!

Not every phone or device can honestly lay claim to that last bit. I've had many phones promise all-day battery life and very few have delivered. At the moment, the only two phones in my collection that deliver on that claim are the Pixel 6 Pro and the OnePlus 10 Pro.

But one feature the Pixel 6 offers (that was debuted with the Pixel 5) is the ability to charge other devices that work with wireless charging. That feature is called Battery Share and it works like a charm. In fact, before my wife upgraded to the Pixel 6, I had to (on several occasions) charge her aging Pixel 4 (which had an abysmal battery) with my Pixel 6. A couple of those instances came at rather inopportune moments when her battery was about to die in the middle of an important phone call. 
Anyone that's ever been in such a situation understands how handy it would be to have another phone to draw some much-needed juice from.
I will show you how to enable the Battery Share feature in the Pixel 6 Pro. The process is also the same for the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 5. 
A word of warning: As you probably expect, using Battery Share does drain your device battery much faster than it would drain without using the feature. Because of this, don't be surprised when you give those other devices a quick boost that your device doesn't have nearly the juice to reach the end of the day. To that end, use Battery Share wisely.

 
## Enabling Battery Share


Swipe the Notification Shade down twice and tap the gear icon to open the Settings app. In settings, tap Battery. In the resulting window (Figure A), tap Battery Share.

In the next window (Figure B), tap the ON/OFF slider until it's in the ON position to enable the feature.

Once you've enabled the feature, you should make sure to adjust the Stop slider to a reasonable percentage that dictates when to stop Battery Share. Out of the box, it defaults to 50%, which is the highest percentage you can configure (Figure C). I wouldn't set this any lower than the default, otherwise, you risk prematurely running out of charge.

## Using Battery Share


To charge other devices with Battery Share, all you have to do is place the device on the back of the phone, at which point the second device should indicate that it's charging.

 
## Quickly disabling the feature


Once you've charged the device in question, you'll want to disable the feature, otherwise, anyone could place their devices on your phone and drain your charge. 
For this, make use of the Quick Tile option, which allows you to tap to enable or disable the feature, directly from the Notification Shade.
To add the Quick Tile for Battery Share, pull down the Notification Shade twice and tap the pencil icon to the left of the power button (Figure D).

Locate the Battery Share Quick Tile (Figure E) and drag it to the top of the window to add it to the Notification Shade.

Once you've done that, tap the left-pointing arrow at the top of the display and the Battery Share tile can then be accessed from the Quick Tile section of the Notification Shade (Figure F).

Congratulations, you can now help out a friend, family member, or co-worker with enough charge to last them through a phone call or meeting. Don't you feel empowered?
