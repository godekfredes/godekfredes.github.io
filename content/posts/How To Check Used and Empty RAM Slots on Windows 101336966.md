Discover How To Upgrade Your PC's Speed: Check Your Used and Empty RAM Slots in Windows 10 Today!

If you're looking for an instant speed boost for your PC, upgrading your system's RAM is an excellent place to start. With some basic PC knowledge and a modest investment, you can upgrade your RAM speed and experience a significant improvement in system performance.

Understanding RAM

Random Access Memory (RAM) is where your computer temporarily stores data for processing. It acts as a high-speed buffer between your system and its working components, such as the CPU. Since your computer's data storage capacity is limited, RAM provides the necessary space to manage multiple programs simultaneously. The more RAM your PC has, the more programs you can run at the same time.

Most modern computers have RAM slots, which means you can add more RAM when necessary. Moreover, Windows 10 makes it easy to identify and update your computer's RAM through its system settings. Here's how:

1. Open the Windows Task Manager

You can do this by pressing the Ctrl + Shift + Esc keys simultaneously or by right-clicking on the taskbar and selecting "Task Manager."

2. Check the Memory Tab

In the Task Manager window, click on the "Memory" tab. This shows you how much RAM your PC is currently using, and you can identify any bottlenecks that may be slowing down your system.

3. Check the RAM Slots

You can find this from the "Memory" tab by clicking on the "More Details" option. In this window, click on the "Performance" tab, then select "Memory." This shows you the number of slots and how many are currently in use.

4. Remove the Cover of Your Computer

Once you've checked your RAM slots, you'll need to open your computer's cover carefully. If you're not sure how to do this, refer to your computer's manual or look for an online tutorial.

5. Check the RAM slots

With the cover off, you can see the number of RAM slots available, and you can easily identify empty slots.

6. Insert New RAM

After identifying your empty RAM slots, insert your new sticks of RAM by aligning it with the slot and applying enough force to lock it down.

7. Power Up

Finally, put the computer back together, restart it, and go back into the Task Manager to check if the new RAM is installed correctly.

Conclusion

If you're struggling with a slow computer, upgrading your system's RAM can make a massive difference. Windows 10's inbuilt memory monitor and RAM slot checker make it easy for novices to identify and upgrade their system's RAM. Remember to do thorough research before buying new memory sticks, and always follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer to avoid damaging your computer's circuits.
