Title: Unlock the Secret to Effortlessly Share or Profit from Your Incredible Photoshop Skills with These Action Creation Hacks!

Introduction: 

Photoshop is a powerful tool for creating incredible images and designs. It takes time to master this software and learn all its features. But once you've got a grip on it, you can create stunning images that can be used in various fields. Why not use your Photoshop skills to make some extra money? Or share with the community and help others improve their designing skills? In this article, you'll learn how to create actions in Photoshop that can be either shared or sold.

Body:
First, let's talk about what actions are. Actions are the recorded series of tasks that you perform in Photoshop, which can be saved and reused later. It's like having your creative genie in a bottle, assisting you in your workday. With the help of these recorded tasks, you can recreate the same effect on any image with just one click. This saves time and makes it easy to apply the same technique to multiple images.

Now there are two ways to monetize these actions. You can either sell them or use it as a marketing strategy for your creative business. But before you jump into action creation, you must find your niche or target audience.

For example, if your niche is wedding photography, you can create a set of actions that are specially designed for wedding photo editing. This gives a more personalized and targeted approach to your target customer. People will be more interested in buying the actions when they know it's made by someone who has expertise in their specific field.

Another example is to create actions by taking inspiration from popular Instagram filters. People are always looking for a way to make their Instagram pictures stand out, and if you have an easy solution, they will take it without hesitation. With a bit of creativity, you can turn trending styles into actions and make them available for people to purchase.

When it comes to sharing your actions, you can use social media platforms, online marketplaces, or your website. Share it on your profile, ads, or even collaborate with other creators to get more visibility. From there, it's just a matter of establishing a fair price point and marketing to your audience efficiently.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, creating actions for Photoshop is an efficient way to make money while utilizing your designing skills. Whether you want to share or sell your actions, it's a win-win situation for both you and your customers. Start by finding your niche and adding your unique touch to it. Don't forget, marketing is just as important as creating the actions. Utilize social media, websites, or online marketplaces to get more visibility. With these action creation hacks, you can unlock effortless sharing or profit opportunities all in one.

##  How to create an action on Photoshop 


In this example, we'll add a light and airy feel to this photo of a child and create an action for it. We'll essentially create a filter that we can save as a preset and run it on other photos.  

 
###  Step 1: Go to the Actions panel, click on Create New Action 


If your Actions panel isn't visible on the right side of your Photoshop window, go to the menu and select Window. From the dropdown menu, select Actions; this will make the Actions panel appear on the right.  
Then, click on the Create New Action button at the bottom of the Actions panel. 

 
###  Step 2: Name your Action and assign a hotkey 


Try to come up with the most efficient and direct way to achieve what you want your action to do. I'll be adding curves, brightness and contrast, color balance, and selective color layers to this photo. You can rename your Action to something easy to remember. 
At this point, you can also assign a Hotkey for your action, but I'll leave mine without one.  

 
###  Step 3: Click Record 


When your popup window has all the information you want, click Record. The recording button will turn red when you start recording. 

 
###  Step 4: Perform the action 


Action! Perform your action so it is recorded. This means you'll add the adjustment layers, filters, and any other edits needed to your photo and Photoshop will record them as a preset. 

 
###  Step 5: Stop recording 


Cut! Press the Esc key or the Stop button once you've completed the commands for your action and the photo looks how you want it to look.  

 
###  Step 6: Test your action 


To test your action, you can open another photo and use the selected hotkey to repeat the preset or just press Play while selecting your Action to add the edits to the picture.  
A big appeal of Photoshop actions is the ability to share them with others, either for free or for a fee. Actions can be imported to and exported from Photoshop, so if you have an idea of what you want to do with your photo but not sure how to get there, you'll probably find an action for it online. This means you can also sell them in the same fashion. 

 
###  Step 7: Place your action in a set 


Create a New Set or folder to place your action in. Click on the folder at the bottom of the Actions panel or select New Set from the Actions menu. 
Rename the new set. It could be a descriptive name of what the Action does or a generic name. This will generate a file so it can be renamed later. 

 
###  Step 8: Save your Action 


 Place the Actions you want to export in the new set you just created and make sure the set is selected. Go to the Actions menu, select Save Actions to export it. 

 
###  Step 9: Choose where to save your actions 


The Actions in the Set will be saved on your computer as .atn files. These can be shared with others, who can load them into Photoshop.  
You can sell Photoshop actions on your own website, or you can sell them as a digital download on an online store, like Etsy, Envato, The Luxe Lens, or Creative Market. 

 
Go to your Actions MenuSelect Load ActionsBrowse your computer for the .atn file to load and select it


This will add the action to your Actions panel and it'll be available to play right away.
