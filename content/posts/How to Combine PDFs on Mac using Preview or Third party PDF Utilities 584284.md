# Unlock the Secret to Streamline Your PDF Workflow on Mac - Learn How to Combine PDFs with Ease!

Do you have a lot of PDF files that you need to merge together to create a single document? Combining PDFs can be a huge headache, especially if you don't have the right tools. Fortunately, if you're a Mac user, there are several easy ways to combine PDFs quickly and easily. In this article, we'll show you how to streamline your PDF workflow on Mac and unlock the secret to combining PDFs with ease.

## Method 1: Use Preview

If you're a Mac user, you're probably familiar with Preview, the default PDF viewer that comes pre-installed on all Macs. Did you know that Preview also has a built-in function to combine PDFs? Here's how to do it:

1. Open Preview and select "File" from the menu bar.
2. Click "Open" and select the first PDF file you want to combine.
3. In the menu bar, select "View" and then choose "Thumbnails" to see a thumbnail of each page in the PDF.
4. Drag and drop the second PDF file onto the thumbnail of the first PDF file in the sidebar.
5. Continue dragging and dropping PDF files until you have added all the files you want to combine.
6. Once all the files are added, you can rearrange the pages as needed by dragging and dropping them into the desired order.
7. Finally, save the combined PDF file by selecting "File" from the menu bar and then choosing "Export as PDF."

## Method 2: Use Automator

Automator is a built-in app on Mac computers that allows you to create automated workflows for various tasks. You can also use Automator to combine PDFs. Here's how:

1. Open Automator and choose "New Document."
2. Select "Application" as the type of document you want to create.
3. In the search bar, type "PDF" and select "PDFs" from the list of actions that appear.
4. Drag and drop the "Combine PDF Pages" action to the right-hand pane.
5. Click "Add" and then select the PDF files you want to combine.
6. Once all the files are added, you can rearrange the pages as needed by dragging and dropping them into the desired order.
7. Finally, save the combined PDF file by selecting "File" from the menu bar and then choosing "Export as PDF."

## Method 3: Use a Third-Party App

If you need to combine PDFs frequently, you may want to consider using a third-party app designed specifically for this task. There are several apps available on the Mac App Store that can combine PDFs quickly and easily, such as PDF Expert, PDFsam Basic, and PDFsam Enhanced.

PDF Expert is a powerful app that allows you to combine PDFs, edit PDFs, and annotate PDFs. PDFsam Basic is a free app that allows you to merge, split, and extract pages from PDFs. PDFsam Enhanced is a more advanced version of PDFsam Basic that includes additional features such as OCR (text recognition) and batch processing.

## Conclusion

Combining PDFs on Mac doesn't have to be a difficult task. Whether you prefer to use Preview, Automator, or a third-party app, there are several ways to streamline your PDF workflow and save time. Experiment with each method to find the one that works best for you, and start combining PDFs with ease today!

In Summary


You can combine multiple PDF files into a single PDF document on a Mac using either Preview or some third-party PDF manipulation utilities.
If you have a subscription to any of the third-party PDF manipulation utilities, you can use them to merge PDFs on your Mac.
On the other hand, if you do not have such subscriptions, Apple’s built-in utility, Preview, does the job in pretty much the same way. And you can even use it to combine part of a PDF into another PDF.







Of these, one such problem is when you have to deal with multiple PDF files — that too individual ones — where you need to edit and transform them into a single PDF, or where you need to extract some part of a PDF file and merge it into another PDF file.
In either case, though, if you are a Mac user, you have a few different ways to combine PDFs. You can either use Apple’s native utility, Preview, to merge multiple PDFs into one PDF or utilize some third-party PDF manipulation software.

 
## How to Combine PDFs using Preview


Apple’s Preview is a very useful utility on Mac. As we already mentioned, it lets you perform a bunch of different operations on various kinds of files and documents without requiring you the need for third-party software. And the best part is Preview comes pre-installed and is absolutely free to use.

 
### Combining multiple PDFs into one


1. Open the PDF you want to add other PDFs to in Preview.
2. Head over to View > Thumbnails to enable thumbnail view in the sidebar.
3. Select the page you want to add new PDFs to.
4. Go to Edit > Insert > Page from File.
5. Next, select the PDF document you want to add and click on Open.
6. All your PDF files should now be arranged one below the other. If required, you can change their order by moving them around.
7. Finally, go to File > Export as PDF, choose the location to save the PDF, and hit Save.

 
### Combining part of a PDF into another PDF


1. Open the PDFs among which you want to move content in Preview.
2. Enable thumbnail view on each of these PDFs by going into View > Thumbnails.
3. Now, hold down the command key, click and drag the content you want to move to the other document, and then release the key. If required, you can click on the pages from the sidebar to reorder them.
4. Finally, go to File > Export as PDF, choose the location to save the PDF, and hit Save.

## How to Combine PDFs using third-party PDF software


If you already use third-party PDF manipulation software like Adobe Acrobat or PDF Expert on your Mac for all your PDF creation and manipulation needs, you can also use them to merge multiple PDFs into one single PDF document.

 
### Combining PDFs using Adobe Acrobat


1. Open Adobe Acrobat.
2. Go to File > Create > Combine Multiple Files into a single PDF. Alternatively, if you already have the file open, choose Combine Files from the right-hand menu.
3. Click on Add Files or Add Open Files, and add the PDF files you want to combine.
4. Finally, click Combine to merge your selected files into a single PDF file.

 
### Combining PDFs using PDF Expert


1. Launch PDF Expert and open the PDF file.
2. Click on View settings on the top-left and choose Split View mode.
3. Now, open the second PDF file that you want to merge, and click on the thumbnail icon.
4. Put your PDFs side-by-side and drag and drop pages among the PDFs you want.

 
## Combining multiple PDFs into a single PDF


Of the three different software that we demonstrated how to merge multiple PDFs into one, Preview definitely comes out on top as the better option. The reason being that Preview is free to use — unlike the other two software — and that it makes the process of combining PDFs on Mac quick and easy. So if you do not already have a subscription to any of the third-party PDF manipulation software and want to merge PDFs on Mac, Preview is the way to go.
