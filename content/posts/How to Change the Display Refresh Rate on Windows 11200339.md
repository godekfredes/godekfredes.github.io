If you're a gamer or a creative professional, you know how important graphics are. With the release of Windows 11, Microsoft has introduced an exciting feature that can enhance your graphics experience even more. You can now change your display refresh rate to optimize your graphics performance.

In this article, we'll guide you through the easy and simple process of changing your display refresh rate in Windows 11, and explain how it can make a huge difference in your graphics experience.

## What Is Display Refresh Rate?

The display refresh rate is the number of times per second that a computer's screen is redrawn. It is measured in Hertz (Hz) and is essentially a measure of how many frames per second (fps) your display can produce.

Without going too much into technical details, a higher display refresh rate means smoother motion and less screen tearing. A higher refresh rate helps reduce motion blur, which can be especially important for gamers, as it can make it easier to see and react to fast-moving on-screen action.

## How Can You Check Your Current Display Refresh Rate?

Checking your current display refresh rate is simple. First, you need to open the Windows Settings app. You can do this by clicking on the start menu, and then clicking on the gear icon.

From there, click on the System option, and then select the Display tab. On this screen, you'll be able to see your current refresh rate. It's important to note that not all displays support high refresh rates, so yours may be limited.

## How to Change Your Display Refresh Rate

Here's how you can easily change your display refresh rate:

1. Open the Windows Settings app by clicking on the start menu, and then clicking on the gear icon.

2. From there, click on the System option and then select the Display tab.

3. Locate and click on the Advanced display settings link.

4. Now select the Display adapter properties for Display 1 (the number may change depending on your system configuration).

5. Click on the Monitor tab and then choose the refresh rate you want from the dropdown menu here. It's important to note that not all displays support high refresh rates and Windows will only display the available options. Your options might be limited to 60Hz, 120Hz, or 144Hz depending on your hardware.

6. Click OK to save your changes.

And that's it! You've successfully changed your display refresh rate. You should notice smoother motion and less screen tearing, especially when playing video games or watching high-motion content.

## Final Thoughts

Changing your display refresh rate is one of the easiest and most effective ways to enhance your graphics experience. With a higher refresh rate, you get smoother motion and less screen tearing, which can be especially beneficial for gaming and video content.

If you're a Windows 11 user who hasn't yet explored this feature, we highly recommend giving it a try. It takes just a few simple steps, and the difference in your graphics experience can be mind-blowing.

If you are a gamer or a video editor, you might want a display with higher refresh rates. The higher the refresh rate, the faster the image changes (or refreshes) on display. A higher refresh rate is essential for a better and smoother viewing experience.
If you have a monitor with a low refresh rate, you will notice screen flickering. It might even lead to headaches and eye strain in the worst case. So, if you have a compatible monitor and a dedicated GPU, you might want to change the display refresh rate on Windows 11.
Although Windows 11 automatically sets the optimal refresh rate, users sometimes need to change the settings manually. Also, Windows 11 has a Dynamic Refresh Rate feature that automatically increases or lowers the refresh rate on high-refresh panels.
