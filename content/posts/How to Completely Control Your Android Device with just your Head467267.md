Unlock the Secret to Ultimate Android Domination: Control Your Device with Just Your Head!

Are you tired of constantly unlocking your Android device with your fingers, swiping through menus, and tapping on the screen? Well, get ready to level up your Android game with a powerful, yet underutilized feature called head gestures!

Yes, that's right – you can control your Android device with just your head movements. With this feature, you can navigate through menus, launch apps, and perform various actions without even touching your device.

So, how does it work?

First, you have to enable this feature on your Android device. Generally, head gesture control is available in the accessibility option under settings. Once you've found it, just enable the option and you're ready to start controlling your device with head gestures.

The most common head gestures used in this feature include nodding, shaking, tilting, and turning. These gestures can be used to navigate through menus, select options, and perform various tasks.

For example, if you want to answer a call, all you have to do is nod your head. You can also shake your head to reject a call. To open an app, you can tilt your head to the right or left. To scroll up or down through a webpage, you can tilt your head in the respective direction. And if you want to go back to the previous screen or exit an app, just turn your head to the left or right.

The beauty of using head gestures is not just about the convenience of not having to touch your screen; it also offers accessibility for people with disabilities that may find it difficult to use conventional methods to operate their devices.

Moreover, this feature is not limited to just Android devices. Apple's iOS also offers similar features, which can be found in the accessibility option under settings. It's called "Head Gesture" for iPhones and "Head Tracking" for iPads.

In conclusion, head gesture control is a game-changer for anyone looking to simplify their Android device usage. It's easy to set up and offers a new level of convenience and accessibility. So go ahead and give it a try, and you might find yourself unlocking the secret to ultimate Android domination!

To help those users, Google Play Store has an EVA Facial mouse app that lets you control your Android with just your head. The application captures the user’s face through the front camera and performs an action based on the movement of the face.

 
## Steps to Control Your Android Device with Just your Head


Even if you don’t have any disabilities, you can still try this cool app on your Android smartphone. Below, we have shared some simple steps to completely control your Android device with just your head. Let’s get started.
1. First of all, download and install the EVA Facial Mouse. This is a free app that you can download and try. Grant all permissions that this app asks for.

2. You will be taken to the system settings screen, where you need to enable the EVA app by using the slider. Another prompt would appear on the screen; press the OK option.

3. Next, tap the Settings button on the screen’s middle. This would take you to the device’s main Settings Menu, where you have to go to the Language & input menu. Next, choose the Current Keyboard option.

4. Next, on the EVA setup wizard, you will notice a small viewfinder on the top of the screen. Tap on it and fit your head inside the viewfinder. You need to position the device 1-2 feet away for perfect calibration. You would be ready for the next step if the app or the wizard prompts “Face Detected.”

5. Next, set up the mouse settings, like the speed of the mouse actions, etc. Note that the mouse moves as you move your head. That’s all! To control the device through the mouse, move your head right, left, up, and down, and the mouse will follow that.
