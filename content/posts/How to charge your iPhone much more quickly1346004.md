Revolutionary Hack: Improve Your iPhone Charging Speed in Seconds!

As an iPhone user, you know the feeling of panic that sets in when you see the dreaded low battery warning. It’s especially frustrating when you realize you forgot to plug in your phone the night before, and now you’re stuck waiting for it to charge. But what if we told you that there's a revolutionary hack that could improve your iPhone charging speed in just seconds?

With this simple trick, you can get your iPhone charged up faster than ever before. Here’s everything you need to know about this revolutionary hack.

The Hack: Using Airplane Mode

Airplane mode turns off all wireless connections on your phone, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular data. When you’re not using these services, they continue to work in the background and drain your battery. By turning on airplane mode when you’re charging your phone, you can eliminate these power-hungry functions and allow your phone to focus on charging.

How to Activate Airplane Mode

Activating airplane mode is incredibly easy. Here’s how you do it:

1. Swipe up from the bottom of your iPhone to access the control center.
2. Tap on the airplane icon (typically located in the upper-left corner). 
3. The airplane mode icon should now be highlighted, indicating that it’s activated.

How This Hack Works

When your phone is using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular data, it's constantly sending and receiving data from the internet. This process uses a significant amount of battery power. By turning on airplane mode, you prevent your phone from doing any of these activities, allowing it to focus solely on charging.

This hack is especially useful if you need to charge your phone quickly. When charging in airplane mode, your phone will be able to draw the maximum amount of power from the charging source without having to compete with other power-hungry services.

Other Benefits of Airplane Mode

In addition to improving your iPhone’s charging speed, there are other benefits to using airplane mode. For example, airplane mode can be used to avoid interruptions during important meetings, movie screenings or any other activity that requires full attention. With airplane mode turned on, you won’t have to worry about any calls, texts or notifications interrupting you.

Also, turning on airplane mode can be an easy way to conserve battery life when you’re running low on power. If you’re in an area with a weak cellular signal, your phone will expend more battery power trying to find a signal. By activating airplane mode, you can prevent your phone from wasting battery power in this way.

In conclusion, this revolutionary hack is a simple way to improve your iPhone’s charging speed. By using airplane mode to eliminate power-hungry functions in the background, your phone can charge up faster than ever before. And with the added benefits of avoiding interruptions, conserving battery life, and avoiding distracting sounds and alerts, airplane mode can be an essential tool for any iPhone user. So next time you need to charge your phone quickly, remember to activate airplane mode and get the most out of your charging time.

But what if you could charge your phone quicker? Well, thankfully, Apple has a few options to help you juice up your phone in record time. 
If you are in a rush and need your phone, there’s a solution. Here’s how to charge your iPhone much more quickly. 

 
## Newer iPhone models


Older iPhones didn’t exactly help in the fast-charging department. But when iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max were released in 2019, the box included an 18W fast charger.

Up until this point, iPhones came with a 5W charging cable with a very slow wall adapter. Sadly, Apple stopped providing wall adapters when you purchased new iPhones in 2020. But you can still get fast chargers on your own.

 
### Using a fast charger


What charger you use really does matter, and using a true fast charger can juice your phone up to 50% faster than other cables and wall outlets. That’s a lot of time saved when charging your phone. 
The thing is, not every iPhone is compatible with fast chargers. The following phones can be used with fast charging cables:

 
iPhone 8iPhone 8 PlusiPhone XiPhone XRiPhone XSiPhone XS MaxiPhone 11iPhone 11 ProiPhone 11 Pro MaxiPhone SE (2020 and newer)iPhone 12iPhone 12 MiniiPhone 12 ProiPhone 12 Pro MaxiPhone 13iPhone 13 Pro
 
### What do I need to fast charge?


If you want to fast charge your phone, you’ll need more than what is in the box. You’ll need at least two pieces of hardware with the right specifications:

 
Apple USB-C to Lightning cableApple USB-C Power Adapter 


You’ll ideally want 20W when it comes to your power adapter. In fact, Apple says you need a 20W or higher power adapter to fast charge your iPhone 12. We recommend the Apple 20W USB-C Power Adapter.
When it comes to the cord, you’ll want a high-quality Apple product that can handle the power of the 20W adapter. For that, you’ll need a lightning to USB-C Cable. We recommend Apple’s Lighting to USB-C Cable.
Looking to save money? You have to be careful with off-brand chargers. You can never be sure of the quality and if it will work as well as you want. But if you are looking to save, we recommend Anker’s Nano Charger and USB-C to Lightning Cable. 
One thing to keep in mind when buying third-party chargers is they must be certified. That way, you know it’s a quality item and won’t pose fire risks.
