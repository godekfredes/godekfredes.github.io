Xiaomi claims to have improved on the customer service front drastically in recent months. They have opened up service centers across all the major Tier 2 cities and has also increased the number of service centers in metros. Recently, Xiaomi announced a new feature that would allow customers to book their service via the Mi Store app. The customers will be issued a Mi Mobile token number and told their number in the queue.
I vividly remember how Nokia had implemented a similar online service booking feature a few years ago but the one that Xiaomi has setup seems to be more intuitive and robust in nature and has a dedicated app as well.

Alternatively, you can visit Mi.hate2wait.io to book Mi appointment with any of the Xiaomi service centers in your town. Select the category of your device which needs service, and then select the product line, enter your Pincode and finally, choose the type of service (Repair at the service center, repair at home or pickup & drop).
The online booking feature for the Mi Service center will ensure that one doesn’t actually have to wait at the service center for their turn. It will also help the visitors to plan their visit according to the real-time queue in any particular service center. That being said I still don’t see a couple of service centers in the list and hope that Xiaomi will extend the online token service to all of its service centers across India in the near future.
