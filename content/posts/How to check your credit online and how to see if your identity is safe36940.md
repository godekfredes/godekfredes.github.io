Title: 5 Surprising Ways to Check Your Credit Online and Protect Yourself from Identity Theft!

Introduction
In today's digital age, it is easy to access information about our credit score with just a few clicks. As we become increasingly reliant on online transactions, identity theft is on the rise. To protect yourself from identity theft, it's important to check your credit regularly to ensure that there has been no unauthorized activity. In this article, we will explore 5 surprising ways to check your credit online and protect yourself from identity theft.

1. Utilize Free Credit Report Services

Many credit reporting agencies such as Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion offer free credit reports annually. Checking these reports not only helps you to monitor your credit score and transactions but also highlights any suspicious activity on your credit report. Ensure the website you use is secure with the BBB icon on their web page.

2. Monitor Your Credit with Mobile Apps

Several mobile apps can help you keep track of your credit score and alert you to changes. Apps like Credit Karma, Mint, and Credit Sesame offer free access to your credit score and can send alerts to notify you of changes to your credit report.

3. Enable Fraud Alerts

Enabling fraud alerts with your bank or financial institution means you will receive notifications when there is any unusual activity or access to your credit. These alerts are sent via SMS or email, alerting you to any suspicious activity that can lead to potential identity theft.

4. Use Virtual Credit Cards

Using Virtual Credit Cards (VCCs) offers a safe and secure way to shop online. VCCs keep your personal credit card information secure by generating a temporary credit card number linked to your account, and it expires after every transaction, therefore not re-usuable if ever exposed.

5. Report Suspicious Activity Immediately

It's always essential to report any suspicious transactions or activity immediately to your bank, credit reporting agency, or credit bureau. By reporting suspicious activity quickly, you can minimize any potential damage to your credit and stay protected against identity theft.

Conclusion
Checking your credit regularly and employing some of these surprising techniques is essential to prevent identity theft. Enable fraud alerts, use free credit report services, and virtual credit cards and listen to notifications from apps, and report suspicious activities immediately. Be vigilant, stay informed, and your credit score will remain secure. Protect your identity today!

## Not created equal


Of course, it would be ideal if all the reporting agencies recognized the same credit score, but unfortunately, that is not the case. Your credit score is the culmination of a variety of factors and calculations that fall under either a FICO Score or Vantage Score.
To help clarify information about credit scores, visit the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau website. This department has a wide selection of resources.

 
## Credit reporting agencies


The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires the three credit reporting agencies, Transunion, Experian and Equifax, to provide U.S. consumers a free credit report every year. There are a variety of ways you can request a copy of your annual report from each agency: 

 
Online: www.AnnualCreditReport.comPhone: 877 FACTACT (877-322-8882)Mail: Download and complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form. Send to:


Annual Credit Report Request ServiceP.O. Box 105281Atlanta, GA 30348-5281
If you submitted your request via phone or mail, your credit report will be mailed to you within 15 days once the paperwork is received.

 
## Credit Sesame


Many consumers hesitate to check their credit because they have heard or read it required a credit card, or that it can negatively impact their score. These couldn’t be farther from the truth.
With Credit Sesame, you merely type in your data such as name, address, birth date and the last four digits of your social security number. You will further need to supply a phone number and answer a few questions to verify your identity. That’s it; your report from Transunion will display in moments.

 
## Credit.com


While Credit Sesame provides your Transunion report, Credit.com delivers your no-cost annual report from Experian. Remember, checking your score does not require a credit card, nor will it hurt your score.
Credit.com will ask you to enter the same information as other sites of this type, including name, address and so on; however, don’t expect the identity verification questions to be the same, as they will vary for security reasons. Your report will display once you complete the verification process.

 
## Credit Karma


If you want to check your free annual report from the third credit reporting agency, Equifax, along with one from Transunion, consider Credit Karma. To view your report, you will need to supply personal info to verify your identity. 
All three of these companies offer additional tips and resources, including which factors affect your score and how to improve it. A paid membership may be necessary for some features.

 
## Banks 


Several banks and credit card issuers provide their customers with a credit report, often weekly or monthly. Check with your local branch or customer service for more details. The following banks offer credit reports for account holders:

 
American Express Bank of AmericaBarclays Chase Citi USAA U.S. BankWells Fargo
