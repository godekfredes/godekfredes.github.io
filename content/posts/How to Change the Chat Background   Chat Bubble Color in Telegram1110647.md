Telegram has been a popular messaging app for years, and it continues to offer new features that make it more convenient and user-friendly. One such feature is the ability to customize chat backgrounds and bubble colors. This adds a unique touch to your chats and personalizes your conversations. In this article, we’ll take you through the steps to revamp your Telegram chats in seconds.

## Step 1: Update Telegram

Before we delve into the customization process, it is essential to ensure that your Telegram app is up-to-date. You can check for updates in the app store on your device. If there is an update available, download and install it.

## Step 2: Choose a Picture

The first step towards customizing your chat background is to select a picture. You can choose from your gallery or search for images using Telegram’s built-in search function. The app has a vast collection of wallpapers to choose from. Once you’ve made your selection, tap on it, and Telegram will prompt you to choose the option "Set as Background."

## Step 3: Adjust the Image

Telegram allows you to adjust the selected image to your preferences. You can zoom in or out, move the picture around, and adjust the brightness and contrast. These options enable you to fit the image perfectly into the chat background.

## Step 4: Change Bubble Colors

The next step involves changing the color of chat bubbles. You can select a different color for individual chats or customize a universal color scheme for all your chats. To customize individual chat bubble colors, tap on the chat, tap on the three dots menu in the upper right corner, and select the ‘change color’ option. You can then select your preferred color.

To customize universal chat bubble colors, tap on ‘Settings’ in the bottom right corner, select ‘Appearance’ and then ‘Chat background.’ Once you’ve changed the chat background color, you can change the chat bubble colors by tapping on the ‘Color’ option.

## Step 5: Preview Changes

After customizing your chat background and bubble colors, preview your changes in real-time to see how they look. You can simply close the customization menus to see your changes in action. If you’re not satisfied, you can go back and make additional changes.
