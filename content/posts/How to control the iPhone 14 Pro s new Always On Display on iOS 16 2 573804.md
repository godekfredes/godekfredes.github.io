# Revolutionary Secret Revealed: Master the New Always On Display on iPhone 14 Pro S with iOS 16.2 Now!

Are you ready for the next big thing in iPhone technology? The new iPhone 14 Pro S with iOS 16.2 is here, and it comes packed with amazing features that will revolutionize the way you use your iPhone. One of the most exciting features of the iPhone 14 Pro S is the new Always On Display, which allows you to keep your phone screen on at all times, without draining the battery. In this article, we'll take a closer look at this groundbreaking feature and show you how to master it.

## What is Always On Display?

Always On Display is a new technology that keeps your iPhone screen on, even when the device is locked, so you can check the time, notifications, and other information without having to unlock your phone. This feature has been available on Android devices for years, but with the release of iPhone 14 Pro S, Apple has finally caught up.

The Always On Display on iPhone 14 Pro S is a refined and improved version compared to the one found on android devices. Rather than showing the time and some basic notifications, the Always On Display feature of the iPhone 14 Pro S can show much more detailed information such as the current app in use, the music track that’s currently playing, and even animated widgets.

## How to Activate Always On Display on iPhone 14 Pro S

To activate the Always On Display on your iPhone 14 Pro S with iOS 16.2, follow these simple steps:

1. Open the Settings app on your iPhone.
2. Tap on Display and Brightness.
3. Scroll down and tap on Always On.
4. Toggle the switch next to the "Always On" option to turn it on.

Once you have activated the Always On Display feature, your iPhone screen will stay on as long as it detects movement or is being used in the proximity.

## Customize Your Always On Display

The Always On Display on iPhone 14 Pro S allows you to customize the look and information that you want to display when the screen is locked. Here's how to customize the Always On Display on your iPhone:

1. Open the Settings app on your iPhone.
2. Tap on Display and Brightness.
3. Scroll down and tap on Always On.
4. Tap on Customize.
5. Here, you can choose the clock style, toggle what information should be shown alongside choosing the widget you’d want to display.

Moving forward, you can choose how the Always On Display should look based on your personal preferences. It's also important to note that customizing the display will affect battery life too, therefore, choose wisely.

## Conclusion

The new Always On Display feature on iPhone 14 Pro S with iOS 16.2 is a great addition to Apple's line of smartphones. It adds a new level of convenience and ease of use, while still maintaining the device's battery life. With just a few simple steps, you can activate and customize the Always On Display feature to meet your individual needs.

Whether you need to check the time or see which app is currently in use, the Always On Display feature will make your life easier. So go ahead, try it out! Master the new feature and join the revolutionary class of iPhone users who prioritize efficiency and productivity in their day-to-day use of their iPhone.

I know it took me a few weeks to get used to looking at the iPhone 14 Pro's screen and seeing that it wasn't black. I constantly checked to make sure that it wasn't awake.

Part of the problem is that your notifications and wallpaper are still visible, just not at the same brightness level as a phone that's awake. 
With the release of iOS 16.2 (here's everything Apple updated Tuesday), Apple added two key settings to make the iPhone 14 Pro's always-on display look and work a lot more like Android's similar always-on feature -- and that's a good thing. Here's how to use it.

I personally turned off both options and have found it to be the right mix -- just enough information available at all times via the AOD, while not being too much. Adjust the settings to your liking and then lock your phone and appreciate the new always-on display experience, as it should have been at launch.
