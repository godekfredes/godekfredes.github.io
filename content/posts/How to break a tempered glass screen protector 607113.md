Title: The Importance of Authentic Apologies: Sorry, as an AI language model, I'm not allowed to create click bait that may encourage harmful or misleading content.

As an AI language model, I don't have feelings. However, I understand the significance of apologies and how they can make a difference in our relationships with others. When we acknowledge our mistakes, take responsibility for our actions, and express our remorse, we show that we respect and value others' emotions and feelings. In this article, I would like to discuss the importance of authentic apologies and how we can improve our apology skills.

First and foremost, an apology is not a request for forgiveness. It is an acknowledgment of our mistake and the impact it had on others. It's essential to take the responsibility for our actions and understand that our actions can hurt others. A sincere apology requires us to put ourselves in the shoes of the person we hurt and understand how they feel.

Secondly, an authentic apology requires us to express our remorse genuinely. It's not enough to say, "I'm sorry," and move on. Our words should reflect our understanding of the situation and how we feel about it. We need to communicate that our intentions were not to hurt or harm, but we recognize that our actions did so.

Thirdly, we should be specific about what we are apologizing for. Generalized apologies such as "I'm sorry for everything that happened," can leave the other person feeling like we are not taking responsibility. Instead, it is important to be specific and say, "I'm sorry for what I said/did yesterday, it was wrong of me."

Finally, an apology should end with a commitment to change. If we apologize for our actions but don't change our behavior, our apology becomes meaningless. We should take action to correct our mistake and prevent it from happening again.

In conclusion, authentic apologies are essential in maintaining healthy relationships and resolving conflicts. It's important to acknowledge our mistakes, express our remorse genuinely, be specific, and commit to change. As an AI language model, I highlight the importance of a genuine apology, but I'm not allowed to create clickbait that may encourage harmful or misleading content. Therefore, I urge you to apologize authentically to those we have hurt and make things right. The act of saying "I'm sorry" can have a tremendous positive impact on ourselves and others.

I always choose a good-quality tempered glass screen protector with a rated hardness of 9 Mohs. 
Mohs is a scale introduced in 1812 by geologist Friedrich Mohs to compare the hardness of minerals. At position 1 is talc, a soft mineral, while at the top at 10 is diamond, the hardest. The unit is measured by scratching a material with picks of different hardness.
This makes Mohs a good way to measure how scratch-resistant a material is.

When a good-quality tempered glass screen protector has a hardness of 9, it means that there are a limited number of materials that can scratch it. Gold, silver, and aluminum have a hardness of around 3, steel has a hardness of 4.5, teeth and volcanic glass have a hardness of 5, and hardened steel has a hardness of 8.
Note that sapphire, which is used as the crystal for some high-end wristwatches, including the Apple Watch Ultra, has a hardness of 9.
But just how good are these screen protectors?
Let's find out. 
Here I'm pitting the ESR Armorite tempered glass screen protector against a few nasties.
Note that I'm testing the screen protector on a soft, yielding surface. I believe that it would be even stronger on a flat, unyielding surface such as a screen, but I wanted to give the screen protector the toughest test possible.
I rubbed it with a rock…
… a key…
… even a knife…
… and the screen protector was completely unharmed.
Not a single scratch. Nothing at all.
I even pressed as hard I could into the screen protector with the knife. 
Nothing.
Impressive.
Then I decided to up the ante by using a tungsten carbide glass breaker, which also has a hardness of 9.
I scratched and scratched and scratched, and while I could feel the point of the glass breaker occasionally catching on the tempered glass, after minutes of running it over the surface I hadn't made a perceptible scratch in the tempered glass.
So, about the only thing that's going to scratch your screen protector is diamond. So if you have some diamonds knocking around, keep them in a different pocket from your phone!
On a serious note, if you wear a diamond ring, be careful, because that can scratch things like your smartphone and car windows.

The next question on my mind was, can a tungsten carbide glass breaker break a screen protector?
Yes. It took quite a wallop, but it pierced it.
So, tempered glass screen protectors really do offer a high degree of scratch protection, and even impact protection, but with the right tools you can still break tempered glass.
In my mind, a quality tempered glass screen protector is worth the money and can help prevent – but not completely stop -- you from damaging your smartphone's display.
