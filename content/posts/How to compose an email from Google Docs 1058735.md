# Revolutionize Your Communication Game: Master the Art of Email Composing using Google Docs!

Communication is an essential part of any business or professional environment. The way we communicate can make or break relationships, influence our ability to collaborate, and ultimately impact the success of our work projects. Email is one of the most common modes of communication, but it can also be one of the most challenging to master. Fortunately, Google Docs offers a powerful platform to revolutionize your email game and help you stand out from the crowd.

Google Docs is a cloud-based document editor that enables you to create, share, and collaborate on documents in real-time. It's an incredibly versatile tool that can be used for everything from writing, editing, and formatting documents to creating presentations and spreadsheets. But did you know that Google Docs can also be used to compose professional emails?

Here are some tips on how to revolutionize your communication game by mastering the art of email composing using Google Docs.

## Use templates to save time and streamline your message

The first tip for using Google Docs to compose email is to use templates. A template is a pre-made document that you can customize to fit your needs. Templates are incredibly useful because they allow you to save time by creating a pre-made layout and structure for your message.

Google Docs has a wide selection of email templates available for free. You can access them by clicking on the "Template Gallery" option in the upper right corner of the main page. Once you've found a template that works for you, simply click on it, and it will open in a new document. From there, you can customize it to fit your unique needs.

## Collaborate with others to improve your message

Collaboration is another essential aspect of effective communication. When it comes to email composition, it's always helpful to get a second opinion. Google Docs makes collaboration easy by allowing multiple people to work on the same document at the same time.

To collaborate on an email draft, simply share your document with the people you want to work with. They can then access the document, make edits, and leave comments as necessary. This functionality is particularly useful if you need to get input from multiple team members or if you're working on a group email.

## Use formatting to make your emails stand out

Formatting is an often-overlooked aspect of email composition, but it can make a significant difference in the effectiveness of your message. By using proper formatting, you can make your emails easier to read, more visually appealing, and more professional.

Google Docs offers a wide range of formatting options, including font styles, sizes, and colors, as well as bold, italic, and underline functions. You can also use bullet points, numbering, and other formatting techniques to break up your message and make it more digestible for the reader.

## Proofread and edit your emails before sending

Finally, it's essential to proofread and edit your emails before sending them. Typographical errors, grammar mistakes, and other errors can make your message appear less professional and detract from your credibility.

Google Docs has a built-in spelling and grammar checker that can help catch some of the most common mistakes. However, it's also a good idea to read through your email several times to ensure that it makes sense and that there are no ambiguities or errors.

In conclusion, email communication is a critical component of any professional environment. By using Google Docs to compose your emails, you can save time, collaborate with others, format your message for maximum impact, and ensure that your message is error-free. The combination of these features can help you revolutionize your communication game and make a lasting impression on your colleagues, clients, and business partners.

Let me set the stage:
You've been tasked to compose emails that are to be sent out to clients, customers, or various stakeholders. Normally, you might craft that email and then copy/paste it such that other team members might read it and give you suggestions on any possible changes. Once you receive the feedback, you work it in and then copy/paste the finished email into the Gmail compose window and send it off.
Also: Google adds project management features to Docs and they're pretty cool
Now, there's a much better way because the Google team has made it possible to create drafts for Gmail directly in Google Docs. You could then share that document with your team, get feedback, and then send the email from within Docs.
You could even create a document and compose multiple emails that are to be sent to various recipients, share the document with your team, and have others help you compose the missives.
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
Let me show you how it's done.
The only thing you'll need for this is a Google account and access to Google Drive.

 
## Creating an email draft in Google Docs
 
### 1. Open a new Google Docs document. 


Place your cursor anywhere in the document.

 
### 2. Click Insert > Building Blocks > Email draft (Figure 1).
 
### 4. Add attachments. 


After you've composed the missive click the blue Gmail icon to the left of the block, which will open a separate pop-up window (similar to the Gmail composer), where you can add attachments, format the body, and more (Figure 3).

 
### 5. Send!


When you're finished, click the Send button and the missive is off to the recipient. After the message sends, you do have to manually close the pop-up window.
If you don't want to send from within the document, you can always go to Gmail and then select the Drafts label (Figure 4), where you'll find the email waiting to be sent. 
And that's all there is to taking advantage of this cool new Google Docs feature. If you ever find yourself needing to collaborate on emails or just want to quickly compose a message while working in Google Docs, now you can.
