Although that has probably worked for you over the years, it's not exactly the most efficient use of your time. And when the number of people you need to gather information from grows, using that method can slow the roll of your workflow.
What do you do?
You use forms. 
Simply put, a form is a way for you to easily gather information from multiple people and have it collected into a single repository, from where you can then use the data collected for whatever purpose you need.
Sounds complicated, doesn't it? It's not. Thanks to Google, creating a form is so simple you'll wonder why you haven't been doing it all along.

## How to create a form in Google Workspace to simplify collecting information 


Let me walk you through the process.

 
## Requirements


The only thing you'll need is a valid Google Workspace account. Google Forms can be used with both the free and paid accounts, so there's no need to upgrade if using the freebie option. That's it. Let's make a form.

For those who have never created a form, I would suggest you look through the gallery to find a form that can serve as a base. For example, you might want to use the Work Request form in the gallery. Locate and click that template to open the form in the editor.
Fill out the necessary information for the question and you're good to go. You can also move items up and down, add images and videos, and add sections. You will also want to make sure to customize the header of the form and include your own information.
And that's all there is to create a form with Google Forms. Using this tool is one of the easiest ways to collect data from users. And because it's free, anyone can take advantage of this tool.
If you go the email route, you'll need to add the necessary recipients. Once you've shared the form, the recipients will fill it out, and the results will automatically be collected in the Responses tab for the form.
