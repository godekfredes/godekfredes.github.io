Are you bored with your phone's plain and boring wallpaper? Do you want to spice up your Android phone's background without spending too much time or money? If yes, then you've come to the right place!

In this article, we will discuss 10 mind-blowing hacks that can help you change your Android phone's wallpaper in seconds. These hacks are easy to use and free of cost. So, let's get started.

## 1. Use Google Wallpapers

Google provides an app called "Wallpapers" that offers a huge selection of high-quality wallpapers for your Android phone. The app is easy to use and allows you to choose from several categories, including nature, landscapes, cityscapes, textures, and more. You can also set a new wallpaper daily using the "Daily Wallpaper" feature.

## 2. Use Your Own Photos

Personalize your phone by using your own photos as wallpapers. To set your photo as wallpaper, open the photo, tap the three dots at the top right corner, and select "Set as Wallpaper." You can also crop the photo to fit the screen or use different styles such as "mosaic" or "fill."

## 3. Use Wallpaper Apps

There are countless wallpaper apps available on the Google Play Store. Some of the most popular ones include Zedge, Walli, and Backdrops. These apps provide a wide range of wallpapers, including live wallpapers, animated wallpapers, and static wallpapers.

## 4. Use Your Favorite Fandoms

Portray your love for your favorite fandom by setting a wallpaper related to it. You can select a wallpaper from TV shows, movies, games, anime, and more. You can also download fan-made wallpapers from various online communities.

## 5. Use the Muzei App

Muzei is a live wallpaper app that updates your wallpaper every day with a different work of art. You can choose the art source and customize how often it updates. If you don't like the art, you can double-tap on the home screen to switch to the next piece.

## 6. Use Icon Packs with Built-in Wallpaper

Many icon packs offer built-in wallpapers that are designed to match the pack's icons. You can download a compatible pack and select the included wallpaper for a cohesive look.

## 7. Use Third-Party Launchers

Third-party launchers such as Nova Launcher and Action Launcher offer more customization options than stock launchers. You can set a different wallpaper for each home screen, set scrolling wallpapers, and apply transition effects.

## 8. Use Widgetsmith to Create Custom Widgets

Widgetsmith is a popular app that helps you create custom widgets for your home screen. You can use your own photos as backgrounds and personalize the widget with text, date, and time. These widgets can be used as wallpaper alternatives.

## 9. Use Colour-Accent Wallpapers

Colour accent wallpapers use a solid color as the background with subtle designs and shapes to create a unique and minimalistic look. These wallpapers are easy on the eyes and offer a refreshing feel to your phone.

## 10. Use Google Photos

Google Photos offers an option to set any photo as wallpaper. You can select a photo, tap the three dots at the top right corner, and choose "Use as Wallpaper." The photo will be cropped to fit the screen, and you can adjust the position to your liking.

In conclusion, changing your Android phone's wallpaper is an easy and fun way to add a personal touch to your device. With these mind-blowing hacks, you can set a new wallpaper in seconds and enjoy a refreshing look every day.

 To start, navigate to your Settings app. Tap Display under the Device heading, then tap llpaper. You’ll get a list of folders of images to browse; tap one to view your options. 
 Each folder has a slightly different layout, which is a little annoying. For instance, tapping the llpapers option leads you to a gallery of sorts where you swipe through thumbnails that appear along the bottom of your screen. The ve llpapers folder shows a list of options,  you can tap on one to preview. Meanwhile, the Gallery   otos folders show scrollable lists of thumbnails. 
 Once you find the wallpaper you like, setting that choice as your wallpaper is the same no matter what—you just tap Set wallpaper. 
 There’s another, perhaps easier way to get to your wallpaper settings on most Android devices. Tap–hold on a blank area of the home screen, avoiding all icons or widgets. After a couple seconds, you should get an option to change the wallpaper or add widgets. 

 
## Finding good wallpaper images


 if your personal photos don’t make good wallpaper photos, check out wallpaper sites like Interfacelift  National Geographic’s wallpaper collection. 
 Flickr, Deviant Art,  kimedia Commons are also good places to look. Many photographers  artists who use those services provide downloadable public domain or Creative Commons-licensed versions of their photos.  
 If the artist or photographer doesn’t explicitly offer a downloadable version, however, be a good citizen  either ask for permission first, or look for something else. Don’t just swipe copyrighted images from the Internet. That’s just not cool.
