# Revolutionize Your App Downloads: Learn How to Easily Shift Your Microsoft Store Downloads Anywhere You Want!

Are you tired of being limited to the Microsoft Store when it comes to downloading apps? Do you wish there was an easier way to access the apps you need on any device? If so, then you're in luck! In this article, we will show you how to revolutionize your app downloads by easily shifting your Microsoft Store downloads anywhere you want!

## The Microsoft Store Download Limitation

One of the biggest limitations of the Microsoft Store is that it only allows you to download apps on devices that have access to the store. This means that if you have a device that doesn't have access to the store, you can't download any apps. Additionally, there may be times when you want to download an app on a different device, but you can't because the app is only available on the Microsoft Store. This can be frustrating, especially if you rely on certain apps for work or personal use.

## How to Shift Your Microsoft Store Downloads Anywhere You Want

The good news is that there is an easy way to shift your Microsoft Store downloads anywhere you want. This method involves using a third-party app store that allows you to download apps from different sources. Here's how to do it:

1. Choose a Third-Party App Store: There are many third-party app stores available, but one of the most popular is APKPure. This app store allows you to download apps from different sources and install them on any device.

2. Install the Third-Party App Store: Download and install the third-party app store on your device. This process may vary depending on the app store you choose, but it should be relatively straightforward.

3. Search for the App You Want to Download: After you've installed the third-party app store, you can search for the app you want to download. Type the app's name into the search bar and click on the download button.

4. Install the App: Once the app is downloaded, you'll need to install it on your device. This process may vary depending on the type of device you have, but it should be relatively straightforward.

5. Enjoy Your App: Once the app is installed, you can enjoy it on your device! You'll no longer be limited to the Microsoft Store for app downloads.

## Benefits of using a Third-Party App Store

Using a third-party app store like APKPure has many benefits. Here are just a few:

1. Access to More Apps: By downloading apps from different sources, you'll have access to a wider range of apps. This means you'll be able to find the apps you need, even if they're not available on the Microsoft Store.

While installing third-party apps, you can choose the installation folder, but this doesn’t happen while downloading apps & games from the Microsoft store.
Well, if you have lots of storage left on your system drive, that won’t be a problem. However, if you are using SSD and have limited storage, installing every app or game in the C: drive might not be an appropriate option.
