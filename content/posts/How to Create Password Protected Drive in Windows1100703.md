It's no secret that we live in a digital age where our private and sensitive information is stored on our computers. However, with so many threats such as hackers, data breaches, and ransomware attacks, securing your files is more important than ever. The good news is that Windows users have a variety of built-in tools to easily and effectively lock down their private files. In this article, we'll explore just how easy it is to protect your sensitive data on Windows.

## Step 1: Create a Separate User Account

The first thing you should do is create a separate user account on your computer. This account should be solely for storing your private files, and you should use a strong password to secure it. To create a new user account, go to the Control Panel, click on User Accounts, and select "Manage another account." From there, click on "Add a user account" and follow the prompts to set up your new account.

## Step 2: Use Windows 10's Built-in Encryption Tool

Windows 10 has a built-in encryption tool called BitLocker that can encrypt your entire hard drive or individual files and folders. The process is simple, and the encryption is powerful. To encrypt your private files, right-click the folder you want to protect and select "Properties" then click on the "Advanced" button. Check the box next to "Encrypt contents to secure data" and click "OK." Your files are now encrypted and can only be accessed with your password.

## Step 3: Create a Backup of Your Files

Even with all the security measures in place, accidents can still happen, and files can be lost. That's why it's important to create a backup of your files. You can use Windows 10's built-in backup tool to create a backup of your private files. To do this, go to the Control Panel and click on "Backup and Restore." From there, click "Set up backup" and follow the prompts to create a backup plan.

## Step 4: Use a Third-Party Encryption Tool

If you want an extra layer of security, you can use a third-party encryption tool such as VeraCrypt or 7-Zip. These tools provide strong encryption for your files, making them virtually impossible to access without your password. The process is simple, and both VeraCrypt and 7-Zip offer easy-to-follow documentation to get you started.

## Conclusion

Securing your private files on Windows is easier than ever, thanks to the built-in encryption tools and third-party software available. By following these steps, you can have peace of mind that your sensitive data is protected from prying eyes. Remember to always keep your passwords secure and create backups of your files, so you never have to worry about losing important data.

Step 3. When you click on the “Create Disk” button, a Hidden disk will show you a warning dialog box that instructs you, not to format or reinstall Windows because data stored in the hidden disk will be lost. This is because the software will create space i.e. hidden container in your Windows Installation Drive. When you reinstall or format, it will backup all your files and folders. To continue your process, click on the “I Will Remember” button.
Step 4. Your hidden disk will be created, and it will appear as a separate division in the File Explorer. You can open and can add multiple files and folders depending on the disk size.
Step 5. Once you have added-on records and folders, click on the “Disable Disk” button, and this will remove the hidden drive from the File Explorer.
Step 6.  In the future, if you want to access your hidden container, simply launch the application and select the drive letter and select the “Create Disk” button. This will open your hidden disk, and you can now easily access your files and folders.
Step 7. You can apply a password on your hidden disk so that no one can see your details and can mess with your hidden drive. For this, on the main window, click on the link “Create or Update Password.”  Enter your new password and email address and click on the “Create Password” button.
From now onwards, when you want to open the Hidden Disk application, it will ask you for the password. If in any case, you forget your password, click on the link “Recover Password by Email” to receive a new password through email.
