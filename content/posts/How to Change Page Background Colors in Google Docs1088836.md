However, Google Docs isn’t particularly customizable. Here’s how you can change the background color of your Google Docs document. The setting can be super handy to spruce up a presentation, make the text easier to read, or just reduce eye strain while typing for extended durations in a dark environment. Students working late at night in dimly-lit rooms would be able to reduce eye strain by switching to a darker background.
The best part about this change is you can quickly revert to the classic black text on a white background in a few simple steps. So, without further ado, here’s how to change the background color of a Google Docs document.
