# Boost Your Xiaomi Mi TV 4 and 4A Performance with this Ram and Storage Clearing Technique!

If you own a Xiaomi Mi TV 4 or 4A, you already know the joys of having an affordable smart TV with excellent features. But as with any electronic device, your TV's performance can sometimes take a hit. One of the main reasons for this is storing too many apps or files on your TV. Fortunately, this problem can be solved by clearing the RAM and storage of your Xiaomi Mi TV 4 and 4A.

## What is RAM and storage clearing?

RAM (Random Access Memory) and storage clearing is a process by which you delete temporary files and cached data from your TV's memory. This clearing helps free up space on your TV and also enhances its efficiency by releasing its occupied capacity. Besides, deleted cache and temporary files don't affect your saved data or personal preferences. 

## How to clear RAM and storage on Xiaomi Mi TV 4 and 4A?

Clearing RAM and storage on your Xiaomi Mi TV 4 and 4A is very simple. Follow the steps below:

### Step 1 - Go to the settings of your Xiaomi Mi TV 4 or 4A.

### Step 2 - Click on the "More Settings" option.

### Step 3 - Click on the "Storage and Reset" option.

### Step 4 - From the "Storage" section, select "Internal Storage."

### Step 5 - Click on "Clear Data."

### Step 6 - Select "OK" to confirm.

### Step 7 - Now, select "Clear Cache."

### Step 8 - Again, to confirm select "OK."

### Step 9 - After the process is completed, restart your Xiaomi Mi TV 4 and 4A.

By following these steps, you can clear your TV's RAM and Storage and improve its performance.

## Tips to improve your Xiaomi Mi TV 4 and 4A performance even further

Apart from clearing the RAM and storage of your TV, you can follow some additional tips to boost your TV's performance even more. Some of these tips are:

### Remove unnecessary apps

Although Xiaomi Mi TV 4 and 4A come with 8GB and 32GB of storage, respectively, it's essential to keep it clean from unnecessary apps as they use up valuable space and slow down the overall performance. Hence, removing unused apps can free up space and quicken your TV's performance.

### Defrag your TV's storage

Defragging is an optimizing process that arranges your TV's files, making them easier for the device to access. This process improves the overall performance of your TV, enhances its speed, and prevents malfunctions.

### Factory reset

A factory reset is a drastic measure, but if all else fails, you can always do that. A factory reset deletes all the data from your TV, erasing your settings, preferences, and apps. Still, it improves your TV's performance by restoring it to its original condition.

In conclusion, Xiaomi Mi TV 4 and 4A are affordable smart TVs with excellent features that deliver quality entertainment at an affordable price. By clearing RAM and storage through the easy steps mentioned above, you can enable them to function with optimal efficiency. Additionally, following some of the essential tips can take its performance to the next level. So, try these quick fixes and enjoy a better viewing experience.

### Clear RAM and Storage on Mi TV 4




 

For all things byte, Xiaomi has bundled a nifty little tool called the “TV Manager” on its Mi TV line of devices. The app lets you execute roughly every storage related task with a click of a button.
To get started, scroll down to the “Apps” carousel on your Mi TV and click the “TV Manager” icon.
You’ll be escorted to a whizzy looking dashboard (which I feel should be allowed as a screensaver) which shows every bit of information there is to know about your television’s memory (what a time to be alive). This includes details of all the active applications, trash data, RAM usage, and more.





 

The “Optimize” button is sort of a one-stop solution for why you’re here in the first place. It takes care of all the aspects of cleaning the storage such as putting down unnecessary background apps which will essentially clear up the RAM, and clean the trash (wouldn’t hate to have this button in real life, honestly).





 

However, if you’re interested in a more granular and thorough approach, you can tap on the individual options on the bottom “More” row — Memory Boost, Trash Clean, or Deep Clean. That last one lets you eradicate things like the app data or large files. You can even perform a complete reset through that.




In addition to that, if you find yourself returning to the TV manager more often than not, you can even enable “Automatic Cleanup” and limit the trash capacity from the settings.
That’s it for this quick guide, let us know in the comments section if you’re stuck at some step. If you’d like to read more about the Mi TV, you can take a look at our first impressions.
