If you are an active Netflix user, you might know that Netflix offers you multiple premium plans. The basic plan of Netflix allows users to stream video content on 480p, whereas the other two plan unlocks the HD and the Ultra HD option.
To ensure Android smartphones can’t be used to redistribute video content and make them secure from Piracy, popular streaming services uses Google’s Widevine DRM platform. Google’s WideVine DRM offers different levels of security – L1, L2, and L3.
Android devices support only the Widevine L1 and L3. The Widevine L1 has the highest level of protection, and it allows streaming video content in HD, Full HD, QHD, 4K, and above on any device. On the other hand, Widevine L3 is the lowest supported option, and it can only play videos in 480p.
For this reason, if you plan to buy an upper-tier Netflix plan to watch content in HD or Ultra HD, you need to ensure that your phone has Widevine L1 certification. Without this certification, you can only stream content in 480p.
