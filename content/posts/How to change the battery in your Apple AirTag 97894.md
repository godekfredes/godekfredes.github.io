Revive Your Apple Airtag In Seconds With This Quick Battery Replacement Hack!

If you're an Apple user, it's very likely that you've heard about the exciting innovation known as the Apple Airtag. This small yet groundbreaking device allows you to track and locate any misplaced or lost item easily, thanks to its interconnectivity with your Apple devices. But like any other piece of technology, it relies on batteries to function, which means it can experience battery drain over time. Fortunately, we have a quick and easy hack to replace its battery in seconds and have it working like new.

The first step in reviving your Apple Airtag is to gather the necessary tools. For this task, you'll need a pair of tweezers and a CR2032 battery. These batteries can be found at most convenience stores, and you can buy them in packs to keep on hand for whenever you need them.

Once you have your tools ready, turn your Airtag over so that the cover is facing up. Using your tweezers, press down on the metal cover where it meets the plastic casing. You should feel a slight give, indicating that the cover is now detached.

Now, you can simply remove the old battery and replace it with the new one. Make sure the battery is properly oriented - the positive (+) side should face up, and the negative (-) side should face down.

After you've inserted the new battery, firmly press the cover back into place until you hear a click. Congratulations, you have just revived your Apple Airtag!

It's worth noting that this hack is suitable only if your Airtag battery is dead, as these devices are designed to last for around a year, depending on usage. However, if you find yourself needing to replace it again at any time, you know exactly what to do.

In conclusion, the Apple Airtag is an essential tool for anyone who wants to keep track of their belongings. It's a cutting-edge device that utilizes the latest technologies, and it can make your life considerably more comfortable. However, like any other device, it’s subject to battery drain. But, no need to worry - with this simple hack you can replace it quickly and efficiently, enjoying all the tracking capabilities of your Apple Airtag once again.

Now, I'm pretty sure that the AirTag will tell me when it needs its battery replaced, but I'm the sort of person who'd much rather deal with this on my own terms than wait for the battery to get to the point it's dead, and then I go and lose my keys. 
You can check the state of your AirTag's battery by going into the Find My app on your iPhone or iPad, tapping on Items, finding your tag and tapping on it. Tapping on the battery icon also shows you the tag's serial number and firmware version. 
And replacing the battery in the AirTag is easy. So easy you can do it in a coffee shop while you have a cup of your favorite wake-up juice. 
I don't want a cheapo battery to spew out its gut inside my $29 AirTag. 
OK. So, you've got the battery. 
Next up is opening the AirTag. I squeeze it between my fingers and thumbs and rotate the stainless steel back anti-clockwise. It can be a bit tricky, especially if the tag is a bit slippery (giving it a wipe with a lens cleaner can help here). 
Remove the old battery. Dispose of it safely. 
Insert new battery (note orientation with + on top). You should hear a chirp coming from the AirTag. If not, remove and change its orientation until you do. 
Replace the cover by aligning the three prongs on the cover, gently squeezing the two halves together, and rotating the stainless steel cover clockwise until it locks into place. 
You're done! 
In the Find My app, you can check if the battery status has changed to confirm you replaced the battery correctly and the battery is good. 
Time for a second coffee as a reward!
