Dirty AirPods? Here's the Ultimate Guide to Sanitizing and Cleaning Them the Right Way!

AirPods are a convenient and trendy way to listen to music, take calls and communicate wirelessly. Like every other gadget, after extended use, they tend to accumulate dirt and grime over time. This accumulation can lead to less than optimal sound quality, and in worst-case scenarios, bacterial and fungal infections. 

Maintaining clean and sanitized AirPods is crucial, as it promotes the longevity of the gadget, improves the sound quality and limits the transmission of germs. Here are the ultimate guide for properly sanitizing and cleaning your AirPods:

What you need 

- Soft-bristled brush
- A clean cloth
- 70% isopropyl alcohol
- A toothbrush
- A cotton bud

Cleaning the exterior 

Firstly, clean the exterior of the AirPods by using the soft-bristled brush to remove any loose dirt and debris. Next, use the clean cloth moistened with the 70% isopropyl alcohol to wipe down the buds and the outer areas that come into contact with the ear. It is important to use only 70% isopropyl alcohol and a clean cloth; any other liquid may damage the electronic circuitry in the device.

Cleaning the air vents 

The air vents can get clogged up with earwax and dust, leading to a reduction in sound quality. Use the cotton bud dipped in 70% isopropyl alcohol to gently clean the inside of the vents. Be careful when cleaning the mesh covering of the vents so as not to damage it.

Cleaning the charging case 

The charging case is also a vital part of your AirPods. To clean the charging case, simply use a clean cloth or a tissue dampened with 70% isopropyl alcohol.

Disinfecting your AirPods 

As much as cleaning your AirPods is vital for hygiene purposes, disinfecting them is just as important. To disinfect your AirPods, use a 70% isopropyl wipe, and gently wipe down the earpieces and while being cautious around the speaker mesh. While disinfecting your AirPods, be careful not to get water or the disinfectant solution into the speaker mesh.

Final Words 

Maintaining clean and sanitized AirPods is vital in promoting the longevity of the device while preserving optimal sound quality. Ensure to clean your AirPods regularly when needed and remember, 70% isopropyl alcohol is your go-to solution for sanitizing your device. Always keep your AirPods in a clean environment, and if you notice any damage, contact an Apple technician immediately.

Some people just give them a wipe off and get on with their day, while others want to go all the way and fully clean and sanitize their AirPods.
Well, my AirPods Pro have seen a lot of use, and they could do with a clean, so I thought that I'd bring you along for the ride.

 
## How to clean and sanitize your AirPods


Note that while I'm cleaning AirPods Pro here, the process is similar for the AirPods too. Apple offers its official guidance on how to clean AirPods here.
Materials needed:
I see people overcomplicating the cleaning process. I like to keep it simple. 

 
A couple of Q-tipsA couple of lens wipesA disposable surface for the cleaning process like a paper towel (so everything doesn't get covered in earwax)


I've come across people who use isopropyl alcohol for cleaning but I'm reluctant to drench AirPods in a solvent. I don't think that dissolving earwax and pushing it deeper into the earbuds is all that good for them in the long run. Then there's the possibility of damaging plastics. 
These Lens Wipes are inexpensive and only contain 40-50% alcohol, so they're less abrasive and fit for cleaning glasses, camera lenses, screens, and, in this case, AirPods.

 
### Step 1: Assess the damage


First, I assessed just how bad things are. Apple replaced my AirPods Pro earbuds a few months ago because they suffered from the crackling issue. They look quite new. The case on the other hand is over two years old, and it looks it. It's scratched, and there are chips that came off. No amount of cleaning or buffing it out is going to make it look new.
I notice that there's also a fair bit of muck trapped in the Lightning port. 

 
### Step 2: Clean the case


I started with the case. There are a lot of nooks and crannies in this design, and they trap a lot of debris. Around the hinge area, where the AirPods sit, and the connectors at the bottom that supply power to charge up the earbuds all seem to be muck magnets. 
However, it's nothing that a lens wipe (you could use a screen cleaner too) and a Q-tip can't solve. I was actually surprised how easily it lifted off. The Q-tip was particularly handy for cleaning around the charge connectors.

 
### Step 3: Clean the AirPods


As I said, the AirPods earbuds themselves were quite clean. However, they did benefit from removing the silicone earbud tips and a general cleaning.

 
### Step 4: Clean the Lightning port


To clean the Lighting port, I used -- gently, with a lot of caution -- the bamboo stick of the Q-tip. Be careful, don't go full gorilla on it, and you should be fine. If you have a can of compressed air, then this might work, too.
My AirPods Pro definitely don't look like new, but they do look a lot cleaner, and are a lot more hygienic.
