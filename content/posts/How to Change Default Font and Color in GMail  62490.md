Are you tired of the same old boring Gmail interface? Do you wish you could have a more visually appealing inbox? Well, you are in luck! In this article, we will show you how to make your Gmail account look better in just a few easy steps.

Step 1: Choose a Theme

The first step to improve the look of your Gmail account is to choose a theme. Gmail offers a variety of themes that you can choose from to customize your inbox. To do this, click the gear icon at the top right of your screen and select "Themes" from the drop-down menu. From there, you can select any theme that you like, ranging from basic colors to scenic landscapes.

Step 2: Change the Density

Another way to make your inbox look better is by adjusting the density. This will alter the spacing between emails, making it easier to read and organize your inbox. To do this, click the gear icon, and select "Display Density" from the menu. From there, you can choose between three options: Default, Comfortable, and Compact.

Step 3: Use Filters and Labels

Using filters and labels is another way to make your Gmail account look better. Labels allow you to categorize your emails, making it easier to find what you need quickly. Filters, on the other hand, allow you to automatically sort your emails based on specific criteria. To create a label, go to the "Settings" menu and select "Labels." From there, you can create a new label and apply it to emails as needed. To create a filter, go to the "Settings" menu and select "Filters and Blocked Addresses." From there, you can set up filters to automatically sort your emails.

Step 4: Install Gmail Add-ons

Finally, installing Gmail add-ons can also enhance the look and functionality of your inbox. Add-ons are third-party applications that can be integrated into Gmail to add features such as email tracking, note-taking, and task management. To install add-ons, click the gear icon and select "Get Add-ons" from the drop-down menu. From there, you can browse and install a variety of add-ons to customize your Gmail experience.

In conclusion, by following these simple steps, you can make your Gmail account look better and more visually appealing. By choosing a theme, adjusting the density, using filters and labels, and installing add-ons, you can customize your inbox to suit your needs and preferences. So, go ahead and give your Gmail a much-needed makeover today!

Every time I compose a mail, I have to change the font type and font size. I personally prefer black colored fonts without bolding or italicizing the text. But many would surely like the text color to be different. Unfortunately, there is no straight forward way to set the default font and color in Google Mail as we have in Microsoft Outlook.

 
### How to Change Default Font and Color in GMail?


Previously, people used to take a longer workaround for this problem by turning on the canned responses and setting the default font and color over there and everytime they had to click on canned responses and select the previously stored font. Luckily, Google has provided a much simpler option to change the default font type, size and color. Follow these simple steps to achieve the desired solution
1. Enable Default Text Styling in GMail. In order to do this, a) Go to Settings –> Labs b) Look for Default Text Styling and select Enable c) Click Save Changes.

2. Once you have enabled Default Text Styling, go to Settings –> General.
3. You can now see Default Text Styling option. Use the Bold, Italic, Font, Size and Text Color buttons to specify the desired formatting.

4. That’s it! When you go back and compose a new mail, you will now see your preferred styling as the default!
Just in case you want to get back the default GMail text styling (can’t think of any reason), go back to Default Text Styling and click on Remove Text Formatting icon to reset.
Hope you find this tip useful!
