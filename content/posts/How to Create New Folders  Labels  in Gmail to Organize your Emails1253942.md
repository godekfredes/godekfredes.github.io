# Revolutionize Your Email Game: Master The Art of Folder and Label Creation on Gmail

Emails have become an integral part of our daily routine. Be it business communication, personal messages, or newsletters, we rely on emails for a variety of reasons. With the increasing influx of emails, it is easier to get lost in a flood of messages. This is where organizing your emails come in handy. And the best way to do it is by creating folders and labels on Gmail.

Gmail is one of the most popular email clients used by millions of people worldwide. With its user-friendly interface, excellent spam filters, and intuitive features, Gmail has become a favorite among email users. However, not everyone is aware of the power of Gmail’s folder and label creation system. Here’s how you can revolutionize your email game by mastering the art of folder and label creation on Gmail.

## Understanding Folders and Labels

Before we dive into creating folders and labels, it is essential to understand what they are and how they work. Folders and labels are tools provided by Gmail to help you categorize and organize your emails.

Folders – as the name suggests, Folders are like virtual folders that help you categorize your emails by any criteria you choose. For example, you can create a folder for work-related emails, personal emails, or any other category that fits your needs.

Labels – Labels are like tags that help you identify and sort your emails based on specific topics or themes. For example, if you have emails related to a particular project, you can assign them a label that reflects the project name. This makes it easier for you to find all emails related to that project in one place.

Now that we have an understanding of what folders and labels are let’s take a look at how to create them on Gmail.

## Creating Folders

1. On your Gmail account, go to the "More" section on the left side of your inbox.
2. Click on "Create new label".
3. Enter the name of the folder you want to create.
4. Choose a color for the folder (optional).
