# You Won't Believe How Many Websites Are Tracking Your Every Move - Learn How To Check Now!

Have you ever wondered why you keep seeing ads for products that you were just talking about, or that you searched for online? You may think it's just a coincidence, but the truth is, you are being tracked. 

Every time you visit a website, data about your activity is collected and used to create a profile of you. This data is then sold to advertisers, who can target specific ads to you based on your interests and behavior. 

But just how many websites are tracking your every move? The answer may surprise you. According to a recent study by Ghostery, a privacy-focused browser extension, the average website has 9 trackers present. 

That means that every website you visit is likely collecting data about you and sharing it with third-party companies. And with the rise of targeted advertising, this tracking has become even more invasive. 

So how can you check which websites are tracking you? The easiest way is to use a browser extension such as Ghostery or Privacy Badger. These extensions will show you the trackers present on every website you visit and allow you to block them if you choose. 

If you want to go even further, you can use a VPN (virtual private network) to encrypt your internet connection and protect your online privacy. 

Unfortunately, tracking is not limited to just websites. Mobile apps also track your activity and collect data about you. The Ghostery study found that the average Android app has 17 trackers present, while the average iOS app has 11. 

To check which apps are tracking you, you can use an app such as Exodus Privacy. This app will show you the trackers present in each app and allow you to block them. 

In conclusion, tracking is ubiquitous on the internet, and every website and app you use is likely collecting data about you. The good news is that there are easy ways to check which websites and apps are tracking you and to take steps to protect your privacy. So take control of your online presence and start protecting your data today.
