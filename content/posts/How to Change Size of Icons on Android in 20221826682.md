# Revamp Your Android in 2022: Learn How to Customize Icon Sizes with These Simple Steps!

If you're someone who loves to personalize your Android device, you know how important it is to have control over the look and feel of your interface. One of the ways you can do that is by customizing the size of your app icons. This is a great way to give your Android device a fresh and unique appearance. In this article, we'll walk you through the process of customizing icon sizes using simple steps to help you revamp your Android in 2022.

## Step One: Download a Launching App

The first step to customizing your icon sizes is to download a launcher app. A launcher app is a third-party application that allows you to customize your home screen and app icons. Popular examples include Nova Launcher, Apex Launcher, and Microsoft Launcher. Once you've chosen your preferred app launcher, download and install it on your device.

## Step Two: Access App Drawer Settings

After installing a launcher app, you'll need to access the app drawer settings. To do this, long-press on any blank space on your home screen. Then, select "Home settings" from the options that appear. From there, select "Drawer settings" followed by "Icon layout." This is where you can begin customizing the size of your app icons.

## Step Three: Adjust the Icon Size

Now comes the fun part: adjusting the icon size. In the "Icon layout" menu, you'll see options for adjusting the icon size, grid size, and label size. Use the slider or numerical values to adjust the icon size to your desired preference. Be sure to hit "Apply" to save your changes.

## Step Four: Arrange Your Icons

Once you've customized the size of your app icons, you may want to rearrange them to optimize your home screen's look and feel. To do this, long-press on any app icon and drag it to the desired location on your home screen. You can also create folders for specific apps by dragging one app icon on top of another.

## Step Five: Explore Additional Customization Options

Finally, once you've adjusted the size and arrangement of your app icons, be sure to explore additional customization options within your launcher app. You can change the appearance of your app icons further, select different themes, and even customize your notification panel's layout.

By following these simple steps, you can easily customize the size of your app icons on your Android device in just a few minutes. Not only does this revamp your user interface, but it also allows you to express your personal style and creativity. Take your Android device to the next level in 2022 and customize your icon sizes today!
