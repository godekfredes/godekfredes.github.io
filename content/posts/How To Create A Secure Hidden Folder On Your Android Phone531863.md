Privacy is one of the most important aspects of our lives. We all have private photos that we do not want to share with anyone, and for good reason. They can be personal, intimate or even embarrassing. But sometimes, even if we hide them in our phone's gallery app or a private folder, they can still be seen by others.

But what if we told you there is a solution to this problem? A simple Android hack that allows you to hide your private photos from prying eyes. You won't believe how easy it is!

Introducing the Calculator Vault

The Calculator Vault is an Android app that allows you to hide your private photos using a fake calculator. The app creates a calculator icon on your home screen, but when you open it, it reveals your hidden photo gallery instead.

To use the Calculator Vault, simply download it from the Google Play Store and install it on your Android device. Once installed, open it and set a password. Next, select the photos you want to hide and move them to the app's hidden gallery.

After you have moved your photos to the hidden gallery, return to the app's home screen and press the calculator icon. This will open the fake calculator, and to access your hidden gallery, simply enter your password and voila! Your private photos are now safely hidden from view.

Why the Calculator Vault is so effective

Not only does the Calculator Vault hide your private photos, but it also provides an added layer of privacy by disguising itself as a calculator. This means that even if someone were to come across your phone and see the app, they would have no idea that it hides your private photos.

Furthermore, the Calculator Vault is easy to use and doesn't require any technical skills or knowledge. It is also free to download and use, making it accessible to anyone who wants to keep their private photos safe.

As you’ll find with all of the apps in this genre. You use a pin number or fingerprint to gain access and provide an email address as a backup. With a backup code if you’re locked out. The interface keeps Material Design, which makes it blend well with Android apps.
Once you’ve started, you can start adding content to the categories. You can upload files and videos to different albums. You want to keep one devoted to photos of a significant other. But these are just suggestions. You can edit and delete any time if stockpiling photos of your main squeeze isn’t part of the plan.The app starts with a 30-day trial period and a premium service of $10 monthly. This includes a space-saving feature that backs your data to a private cloud, provides trash recovery, and eliminates advertisements. Keepsafe says all the content is end-to-end encrypted and not viewed by the company.You can also disguise the app with another icon. Even create a decoy number if you need to fool someone about what the app is really. Keepsafe will also perform break-in alerts by logging the time and snapping a photo of a suspicious attempt.

 
## Gallery Vault-Hide Photo Video


Another solid choice is GalleryVault. The basic feature set is pretty similar, though the layout emphasizes a wider variety of content for you to save. The app also offers clever features to make it a ghost on your home screen. You can hide the icon and launch GalleryVault by typing a pin into your dialer. A URL in the browser. Or use a couple of covert methods to gain access.
GalleryVault is another solid choice, though the best features require a subscription.
The dialer requires you to grant additional permissions in the Android settings menu. But GalleryVault will walk you through it. Once you’ve set up your security layer, you can add images, videos, files, and anything else you want to upload. From here, it’s pretty self-explanatory in terms of adding content. But as with other apps, remember that uploading something doesn’t eliminate where you pulled it from. Manually delete photos you don’t want seen.The app is free, and it’s ad-supported. If you want to remove the ads or get some more features. It’ll cost you a one-time payment of $15 through an in-app upgrade. What you get are the Pro version and impressive extras. It includes fingerprint unlock and the ability to close the app by shaking your phone. With a quick photo of the perpetrator if someone tries to break in.

 
## Folder Lock


Another choice to consider is Folder Lock. A recommendation would be to go for the $4 Premium Folder Lock Pro. Make the most out of the extra security features. That includes a private cloud, the ability to hide the icon, and a rather creative panic mode. That offers a button for quickly switching from one app to another. In case you sense someone is looking over your shoulder.
 Folder Lock gives you a grid layout of all the different type of places. For you to save content you want to keep private.The interface isn’t relatively as smooth as the other two options in the list. But the feature set is pretty solid. If you’re looking for an app that is very straightforward about categorizing your secret content. It also doesn’t require a subscription. It is a lovely difference-maker in an era. Where practically every service out there tries to make do with some type of monthly revenue stream.
