## Unlock The Secret To Finally Updating Your Home Address on Google Maps in 2022!

Are you tired of constantly being asked for directions to your home, only to find out that Google Maps is directing people to the wrong location? Or perhaps you've recently moved and want to update your home address on Google Maps, but don't know how to go about it? Well, you're not alone.

Updating your home address on Google Maps can be a daunting task, but with the right information and guidance, it can be done seamlessly. In this article, we'll explore some of the most effective methods for updating your home address on Google Maps in 2022.

### Method 1: Use The In-App Feedback Form

Google Maps offers an in-app feedback form that users can use to report errors or make changes to their home address. To access this feedback form, open the Google Maps app and tap the "menu" icon in the top-left corner. Next, select "Send Feedback" then "Edit Home or Work."

Once you've accessed the feedback form, enter your updated home address and click "Submit." Your changes will then be reviewed by Google, and if approved, your home address will be updated on Google Maps.

### Method 2: Request A Verification Postcard

If you've recently moved and want to verify your new home address on Google Maps, you can request a verification postcard. To do this, sign in to Google My Business and select the "Verify Now" option next to your home address. Next, click "Mail" to request a postcard to be sent to your new address.

Once the postcard arrives, enter the verification code on the postcard in your Google My Business account. This will verify your new address, and your updated home address will be reflected on Google Maps.

### Method 3: Use Google Map Maker

Google Map Maker is another effective method for updating your home address on Google Maps. This tool enables users to add or edit map features, including home addresses. To access Google Map Maker, sign in to your Google account and go to the Google Map Maker website.

Once you've accessed Google Map Maker, select the "Edit" button and then choose the "Add a Missing Place" option. Next, enter your updated home address and click "Save." Your changes will then be reviewed by Google and, if approved, will be updated on Google Maps.

In Conclusion,

Updating your home address on Google Maps might seem like a complicated task, but it doesn't have to be. By using methods such as the in-app feedback form, requesting a verification postcard, or using Google Map Maker, you can update your home address and ensure that it's accurately reflected on Google Maps. So, go ahead and give it a try - after all, 2022 is the year you finally unlock the secret to updating your home address on Google Maps!
