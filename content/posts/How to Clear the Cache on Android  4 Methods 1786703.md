# You've been using your Android wrong this whole time: Learn how to clear the cache in just 4 easy steps! 

You might not realize it, but your Android smartphone could be running a bit slower than it should be. Sure, you've deleted unnecessary apps and files, but have you ever tried clearing your cached data? If not, then you might be using your Android wrong this whole time. 

Thankfully, clearing the cache on your Android is easy and only takes four steps. Here's everything you need to know! 

## Step 1: Access Your Settings 

To start clearing your cache, you'll first need to access your smartphone's Settings menu. You can typically find the Settings icon on your home screen or in the app drawer. Once you've found it, click on it to proceed. 

## Step 2: Locate the 'Storage' option 

After accessing your Settings, you'll need to locate the 'Storage' option. It could be named differently depending on your smartphone model or version of Android, so keep an eye out for terms like "Device Maintenance," "Storage and USB," or "Storage." Once you find it, click on it to proceed. 

## Step 3: Clear Cached Data 

Now that you've located the 'Storage' option, click on it to open up the storage settings. From here, you should see an option to "Clear Cache." Click on that option, and your device will start clearing out any temporary files and data that's been stored in your cache. 

## Step 4: Confirm the Clearing of Cached Data 

After you click, "Clear Cache," you'll be asked to confirm whether you want to clear out your cached data. Click "OK" to confirm, and your Android device will start clearing the cache in the background. This process may take a few seconds or minutes, depending on how much cached data your smartphone has accumulated over time. 

And that's it! You've now cleared your cache, making room for new and important files and data to be stored on your Android device. Clearing your cache is an easy way to speed up your device and keep it running smoothly. 

In conclusion, if you've never cleared your cached data before, you've been using your Android wrong this whole time. However, now that you're equipped with this simple four-step guide, you can keep your Android device running at peak performance. Happy clearing!

Basically, this is a process that all of us have ever done, especially when the smartphones had low storage capacities, and at that time we all know, that there are very few smartphones that had offered the possibility of expanding internal memory through microSD cards.

 
### What is cache?


The cache is an extremely fast access memory that simply stores all the copies or essential elements of an app so that we can have very fast access to them. Basically, Android holds an amount of memory to cache the data of each application.
Each of the apps that are installed on an Android device has a small amount of available cache memory, while some apps even allow the user to choose how much maximum cache memory can be stored.
Since generating content like thumbnail images, graphics or other multimedia files that are integrated into the app will require the use of system resources like CPU cycles or battery mAh, at that time apps simply decide to store this type of content in the cache of which they have.
In this way, even if the app is closed, when the user executes it again, this content will not have to be generated again, as it will be enough to access the cache to simply recover it.
