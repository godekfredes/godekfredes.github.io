If you're the proud owner of an Honor 5X, then you already know that it's a powerful and affordable smartphone that packs a punch. However, did you know that there are plenty of customization settings that you can tweak to take advantage of its full potential?

In this article, we'll cover some quick settings customization tips that will help you unlock the hidden power of your Honor 5X.

## Enable Developer Options

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of customizations, you need to enable developer options on your phone. To do this, go to "Settings," then "About Phone," and find the "Build Number." Tap the build number seven times, and you'll get a pop-up message telling you that you've enabled Developer Options.

## Maximize Your Battery Life

If you're like most people, you probably worry about your phone's battery life all the time. One of the quickest ways to maximize battery life is to turn off Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS when you're not using them. You can also lower your screen brightness, enable battery saver mode, and kill background processes.

## Customize Your Quick Settings

One of the best things about the Honor 5X is that it lets you customize your quick settings menu. This means you can add, remove or rearrange the quick settings tiles that appear when you swipe down from the top of your screen. To do this, swipe down to open the notification panel, then swipe down again to reveal the quick settings menu. Click on the "edit" button, and you'll be able to customize your quick settings menu to your heart's content.

## Use Gestures

The Honor 5X has built-in gesture support that can make your life a lot easier. For example, you can double-tap the screen to wake your phone up, draw an "O" to launch the camera, draw a "C" to open up the contacts, and so on. You can enable these gestures by going to "Settings," then "Smart Assistance," then "Motion Control," and selecting the gestures you want to use.

## Revamp Your Lock Screen

The lock screen is the first thing you see when you turn on your phone, so why not make it more personalized and functional? You can change the lock screen wallpaper, customize the lock screen clock, add a quick launch widget, and more. To customize your lock screen settings, go to "Settings," then "Lock Screen Style." There you'll find a variety of customization options to play around with.

In conclusion, the Honor 5X is a versatile smartphone that lets you customize a variety of settings to fit your needs. By following these quick customization tips, you'll be able to unlock its full potential and experience a smoother, more personalized smartphone experience.

Beside looking pretty, Huawei has also loaded its Emotion UI with tons of features and enhancements. In some places, the company has also greatly customised some parts of Android, which deviates greatly from stock Android. The Quick Settings panel is one such part of the OS that Huawei has greatly customised according to its own liking.

Unlike stock Android, Emotion UI on the Honor 5X offers a dedicated page for Quick Toggles, which comes with plenty of toggles that can be customised to one’s liking as well. Here’s how:
Step 1: Expand the notification bar and tap on ‘Shortcuts.’ Scroll down to the very bottom of the page and tap ‘Edit’.
Step 2: Now drag and drop the tiles around to rearrange them according to your liking. Sadly, Huawei does not offer any way to remove unwanted tiles from the Quick Settings panel, so the panel will always be full of tiles that you want or not.
Once you have rearranged the tiles in the order you like, simply tap on the tick icon located at the top right corner of the display.
