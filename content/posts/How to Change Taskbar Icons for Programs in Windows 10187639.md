# Revamp Your Boring Taskbar! Learn How To Customize Program Icons in Windows 10

It's the age of personalization and customization, and that goes for our computer desktops too. While Windows 10 has come a long way in terms of design and functionality, it can still feel a bit boring at times. The same old program icons on the taskbar can become monotonous and unexciting. But did you know that you can easily customize program icons in Windows 10? It's a simple process that can add a bit of flair and personal touch to your desktop experience. Here's how you can get started:

## Step 1: Choose the program you want to customize

The first step in customizing program icons is to choose the program you want to work with. Right-click on the program's icon in the taskbar and select "Properties." You'll see a small window appear that contains information about the program.

## Step 2: Customize the program icon

In the Properties window, click on the "Change Icon" button at the bottom. This will open up a new window with several icons to choose from. You can select any of these pre-set icons if you like. However, if you want to use your own custom icon, click on "Browse" and navigate to the location where your custom icon is saved. Once you've selected the icon you want, click "OK" to save it.

## Step 3: Pin the customized program to the taskbar

Now that you've customized your program icon, you'll want to make sure it stays on your taskbar for easy access. Simply right-click on the program icon in the taskbar again, then select "Pin to Taskbar." That's it! Your personalized program icon will now stay put on the taskbar, even when you restart your computer.

## Conclusion

Customizing program icons in Windows 10 is a quick and easy way to spice up your desktop and add a personal touch to your workspace. With just a few simple steps, you can make your taskbar your own and keep your favorite programs at your fingertips. So go ahead and revamp your boring taskbar today!
