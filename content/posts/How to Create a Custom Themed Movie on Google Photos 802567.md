In this step-by-step guide, we'll show you how to unlock the secret to creating amazing movies on Google Photos.

## Step 1 - Select Your Photos

The first step in creating your personalized movie is to select the photos you want to include. Choose from your collection of captivating photos and select the ones that you want to feature. There is no limit to the number of pictures you can use, but a good tip is to keep your selection concise and attention-grabbing.

## Step 2 - Create a Movie

Once you have selected your photos, it's time to create a movie. Open your Google Photos app, and click on the "Assistant" tab at the bottom of the screen.

You can also choose to create a movie with no theme by selecting "Classic."

## Step 3 - Add Music

An emotional, heartfelt soundtrack can complete the emotions captured in the photos. Pick tracks that align with the mood and tone of the photos selected. Google Photos has an extensive library of music to choose from or import your playlist from your music player.

## Step 4 - Edit and Personalize Your Movie

After completing your initial draft, it's time to edit and personalize your movie. Click on the pencil icon on the top right corner of the screen. From here, you can rearrange the sequence, trim and delete photos, add captions, and adjust the color effects. You can also adjust the duration of each picture and add transition options.

## Step 5 - Share Your Creation

After perfecting your movie, it's time to share your personalized creation with the world. Click on the "Share" icon on the bottom left corner, and share it with your contacts, family, and friends via email, social media, or messaging apps. You can also download the movie on your phone and share it personally.

### Create a Custom Themed Movie on Google Photos
 

For starters, make sure you have the latest version of Google Photos (iOS/Android) installed on your phone. Movie themes can be accessed on the web in case you don’t want to update. In addition to that, do note that all your pictures and videos need to be synced with Google Photos in order for this to work.
To get started, head into the Assistant tab located on the left.
Tap the green Movie icon and select any one of the available themes. Click “Get Started” from the pop-up.
Next, depending on the theme you chose, you will be either notified as soon as the clip is ready or asked to pick a protagonist.
For instance, if you select “They Grow up so Fast”, the app will ask you to choose a child. However, movies with themes like the “Smiles of 2017” will be automatically generated.





 

Once Google Photos processes your movie, it will send you a notification, tapping on which will take you to the editing page.
Here, you can alter the background music, exclude or include more shots, filters and add a title. Once done, hit the save button for exporting it to your library.
