# STOP Wasting Your Time on Distractions - Learn How to BLOCK Any Website on Your Computer NOW!

We all have been there. You sit down at your desk, determined to be productive and complete your work, only to find yourself scrolling through social media or watching videos on Youtube for hours on end. The internet is a wonderful tool, but it can also be a major distraction.

The good news is that you don't have to rely on sheer willpower alone to stay focused. Instead, you can take control of your browsing habits by blocking any websites that tend to distract you from your work. Whether it's Facebook, Instagram, or a favorite news site, there are a variety of tools available that can help you stay on task.

Here are some of the best ways to block distracting websites on your computer:

## 1. Install browser extensions

One of the easiest ways to block distracting websites is to install a browser extension that specifically does this. There are many options available for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and other popular web browsers. Some of the most popular include StayFocusd, Freedom, and Cold Turkey.

These extensions work by allowing you to set up a list of websites that you want to block, and then preventing you from accessing them during certain times of the day. Some even allow you to set up a "time limit" for each website, so you can only spend a certain amount of time on them each day.

## 2. Use the built-in parental controls

If you're using a Mac, you can use the built-in parental controls to block websites that you find distracting. This feature is typically used by parents to restrict access to certain websites for their children, but it can also be helpful for adults looking to stay focused.

To use parental controls, go to System Preferences > Parental Controls and select the user account that you want to set restrictions for. From there, you can choose which websites to block, as well as set time limits for computer use.

## 3. Change your DNS settings

If you're looking for a more advanced solution, you can change your DNS settings to block certain websites at the network level. This requires a bit more technical know-how, but it can be a powerful tool for those who want to eliminate distractions entirely.

Services like OpenDNS allow you to create custom "white lists" and "black lists" of websites that you want to allow or block. You can then configure your router or computer to use this service as your DNS provider, preventing you from accessing any websites that you've added to your black list.

## Final thoughts

No matter which method you choose, blocking distracting websites can help you improve your productivity and stay focused on your work. It's important to remember, however, that these tools are only a part of the solution. To truly stay focused, you'll also need to practice good time management techniques, avoid multitasking, and take regular breaks to recharge your brain.

So make use of these tools, but also be mindful of your own habits and tendencies. With a little bit of effort, you can transform your browsing habits and become a more productive, focused worker.
