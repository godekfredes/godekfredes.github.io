# Discover the Secret Trick to Surf Reddit Unnoticed - Stay Invisible in 2022 Now!

As we dive into 2022, the internet continues to grow, and so does its user base. There are various social media platforms that have caught the attention of millions worldwide, one of them being Reddit. Being a part of the Reddit community can be entertaining and informative but sometimes overwhelming as it is believed that you can never truly surf the platform unnoticed. 

But what if somebody tells you that you can master the art of surfing Reddit unnoticed, well, you can, with the help of a few tips and tricks. In this article, we will discuss in detail the secret trick to surf Reddit unnoticed - stay invisible in 2022 now!

## Help Yourself to a VPN

The first and foremost thing you need to do when browsing the internet, let alone Reddit, is to invest in a good VPN (Virtual Private Network). It is a private network that enables users to send and receive data as if their devices are connected to a private network. 

VPNs function as a secure and encrypted tunnel between your computer and the internet, with an extra layer of security to protect your privacy. Your actual IP address is concealed, preventing hackers from tracking your browsing history and monitoring your online activity, making it tough for anyone to pinpoint your location.

## Keep a Check on Your Settings

You can also make use of some of Reddit's in-built privacy settings. Head over to preferences, and you will find some settings that enhance your privacy level. For instance, you can select to hide your profile from search engines or prevent people from looking up your account by using your email address or mobile number.

Another thing you can do is set the “Who can send you private messages” option to trusted users only. This will help you avoid being spammed with solicitation messages and keeps your inbox clean and private.

## Overpower the Informative Feed

On Reddit, one of the main things that could give away your online presence is the informative feed, a list of topics, subreddits users joined, and the like. A user can check out your feed and easily deduce your interests and other personal details. 

To avoid this scenario, Reddit has an option that enables users to browse now while hiding their informative feed. To do this, click on the shield icon on the top right and enable it to browse Reddit in incognito mode.

## Introducing the NSFW Mode

Last but not least, the NSFW mode, which stands for “Not Safe For Work,” is an excellent privacy feature that Reddit offers. The NSFW mode will blur out any explicit content from NSFW-appropriate subreddits you go to, leading to cautious browsing without giving away the user's interests.

Make sure you have turned on this option on your Reddit account’s settings for an uninterrupted browsing experience.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, surfing Reddit unnoticed might sound impossible. However, with the right precautions, it’s indeed achievable. All the tips mentioned in this article are easy to follow and do not require any technical knowledge. So, what are you waiting for? Start implementing these tips and enjoy surfing Reddit without being noticed!
