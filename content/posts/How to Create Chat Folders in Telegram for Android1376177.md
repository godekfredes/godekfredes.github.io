You've Been Using Telegram All Wrong - Discover the Simple Trick to Organize Your Chats Like a Pro!

If you're a Telegram user, you probably have a lot of chats going on at the same time. With friends, family, and work colleagues all in one place, it can be hard to keep track of everything. But there is a simple trick that can help you organize your chats like a pro.

The trick is to use folders. Telegram has a feature that allows you to create folders to group your chats. This way, you can separate your work chats from your personal chats, or your family chats from your friends' chats. You can even have a folder for your favorite channels.

Creating a folder in Telegram is pretty simple. Here are the steps:

1. Open Telegram and go to the Chat section.
2. Swipe left on a chat you want to move to a folder.
3. Tap on "New Folder" at the bottom of the screen.
4. Give your folder a name and add more chats by swiping left on them and selecting "Add to folder" or "Move to folder."

That's it! You now have a folder where you can keep all your related chats.

But that's not all. Telegram also has a feature called the "Unread" filter that allows you to see only the chats with unread messages. This can be useful if you want to stay on top of important messages without being distracted by other chats.

To use the Unread filter, go to the Chat section, swipe left, and select "Unread." Now you can see only the chats with unread messages. You can also select the "Pinned" filter to see only your pinned chats.

With these simple tips, you can take control of your Telegram experience and stay organized like a pro. Give it a try and see how much easier it is to keep track of all your chats.

While using Telegram on Android, we accidentally discovered a hidden feature. Telegram has something called ‘Chat Folders’ that allows you to categorize your chats into different labels.
Since we follow many channels and groups on Telegram, having a ‘Chat Folder’ feature means we no longer need to worry about chat management. You can easily create Chat folders with different names like Work, Family, Friends, and appropriate contacts. With the Chat folder feature, the user-interface of Telegram gets super clean and more comfortable to manage.
