However, what if the font you have downloaded appears small in size, and if it’s difficult to read? In this case, you can make your system fonts larger on Windows 10. Apart from changing fonts, Windows 10 also allows you to change the font size.
You can adjust the font size manually from the Windows 10 settings, and the new text size will be applied system-wide. Unfortunately, that means increasing the font size will also enlarge the texts on apps and web browsers.
