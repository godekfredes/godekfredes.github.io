The Hugo Writing Format:

I. Identify the Skills you Need to Develop

To become a highly paid cloud engineer, you need to identify the skills you need to develop. These skills are fundamental to cloud engineering and include:

a) Knowledge of Cloud Platforms - You should have a sound understanding of cloud platforms such as Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) or any other cloud platform, as these are crucial to cloud engineering.

b) Programming Languages - You should be familiar with programming languages, including Python, C++, and Java. A basic understanding of scripting languages like Bash, Powershell, or Perl can also come in handy.

c) Networking - You should have a good grasp of how to implement and maintain network infrastructure in the cloud.

d) Security and Compliance - You should be well versed in security and compliance standards.

II. Develop your Skills with Relevant Training

Once you identify the skills that need developing, you need to work on them by attending training courses or workshops that offer the necessary training. Some of the most popular training courses include:

a) AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate: This certification provides you with an understanding of how to develop and manage an AWS infrastructure.

b) Azure Fundamentals - Microsoft: This certification is designed to provide a foundation for professionals who wish to work with Microsoft Azure.

c) Google Cloud for AWS Professionals - Coursera: This uncertified course helps those well-versed with AWS migrate to Google Cloud.

III. Network and Build Your Portfolio

Networking is key to unlocking the potential of becoming a highly paid cloud engineer. Joining cloud forums, attending industry events, and associating with other cloud engineers in your field will enhance your network. Additionally, don’t shy away from contributing to open-source projects or creating your cloud projects, which will help in building a robust and diverse portfolio.

IV. Be Prepared to Continuously Learn and Adapt

The demand for cloud engineering continues to grow, and you should be prepared to keep up with the ever-changing field. Be adaptable to change, keep learning and keep your skills/up-to-date.

Conclusion:

Becoming a highly paid cloud engineer is an achievable goal, but it takes time and continuous hard work. Focus on building relevant skills, attending training if needed, networking, building your portfolio, and consistently learning and adapting to the changing landscape. The rewards of becoming a highly paid cloud engineer are immense; so why not start your journey today!

Cloud engineers allow businesses to integrate cloud technology to keep databases secure and accessible.
However, Forbes reported in 2020 that a scarcity of qualified professionals currently undermines the overwhelming demand for cloud engineers. If you're thinking about filling the gap, this page is for you.
Read on to learn more about the process of education, certification, and training involved in becoming a cloud engineer.

 
## What do cloud engineers do?


Cloud engineers build and maintain cloud-based infrastructure. Their responsibilities may include:

 
Designing, managing, and implementing cloud-based applicationsHelping businesses migrate databases to cloud infrastructureNegotiating with vendors on issues such as cost-control, scalability, etc.


They collaborate with other IT team members and keep upper management informed on cloud-migration project status.
The typical cloud engineer specializes in one cloud-service vendor, such as:
Industries where cloud engineers usually work include computer systems design and finance and insurance. They may also work in company and enterprise management.
Specialized roles within cloud engineering include:

 
Cloud architectCloud developerCloud administrator


These roles require specific expertise. Cloud developers, for instance, primarily develop cloud-based applications and services.

 
## Skills you need to become a cloud engineer


Cloud engineers' work draws upon a mixture of technical and managerial skills. They need education and training in technical skills in areas such as network services configuration and software engineering to possess basic competence. 
However, they also need business-related soft skills to collaborate effectively with management and service providers.

## How do I become a cloud engineer?


Cloud engineer is typically not an entry-level position. Most cloud engineers work as software engineers or IT managers before crossing over. Recent graduates can sometimes secure work as a junior engineer under an experienced cloud engineer.
Becoming a cloud engineer entails gaining the required skills and experience through college, graduate certificates, certifications, a bootcamp, or work.

 
### 1. Earn a bachelor's degree in IT or computer science. 


To work as a cloud engineer, you typically need an information technology degree at a bachelor's level. A computer science degree can also make your resume attractive, with its broad scope and emphasis on theory. Some common majors, typically available both online and in-person, held by cloud engineers include:

 
Software engineeringNetwork engineeringDatabase management


Many cloud engineers bolster their bachelor's with a graduate certificate in cloud computing/engineering.
However, not all employers demand a degree. Successfully completing a coding bootcamp and demonstrating your skills during a technical interview may be enough to land a job.

 
### 2. Learn coding through coding bootcamp(s), your degree, and/or self-study.


A cloud engineering career usually requires a working knowledge of at least one programming language. Cloud engineers should consider learning:

 
JavaC++PythonRubyPHP


Mastering multiple computer languages is a smart choice, as it makes you more versatile and attractive to employers. Luckily, Python, PHP, and Ruby are among the easiest programming languages to learn.
You can learn to code in a variety of ways. Your IT/computer science bachelor's will likely feature required coursework in Java, C++, or Python. Coding bootcamps provide another path. Most coding bootcamps last 3-6 months and cost $5,000-$30,000.
You can also learn to code independently through resources such as free online coursesand websites for practicing programming problems.

 
### 3. Earn relevant certifications.


Professional certifications are essential to a cloud engineering career because they showcase your skills with commonly-used vendors. Popular certifications that can prove helpful include:

 
AWS certifications, including Cloud Practitioner, Solutions Architect, Developer, SAP on AWS, and SysOps Administrator at varying levelsGoogle Cloud Platform certifications, including Professional Cloud Architect, Professional Cloud Developer, and Professional Cloud Security EngineerMicrosoft certifications, including Microsoft Certified: Azure Developer Associate and Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals


You can also earn cloud computing certifications from vendor-neutral providers such as EXIN and CompTIA.

 
### 4. Gain relevant experience in the tech industry.


Experience is another important factor in advancing a cloud engineering career. Many skills a successful cloud engineer needs, particularly managerial skills, cannot be learned in a classroom. They must be developed in the workplace.

 
### 5. Create your resume and apply for cloud engineering roles.


Now it's time to create a winning resume. When crafting your resume for a cloud engineering job, pay particular attention to the following tech skills:
Emphasize internships, jobs, and academic or personal projects relating to IT, software engineering, and data science when discussing experience.
You can expect interviewers to ask what troubleshooting processes or collaborative methods you have used to resolve cloud integration and security/access-related issues. Prepare ahead of time to collect your thoughts. 
In addition to a typical behavioral interview, practice for a technical interview where you may be asked to code or solve a problem in real time. Know your toolbox inside and out.
