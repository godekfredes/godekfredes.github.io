The beauty of most search engines is that you can customize your experience. For instance, search engines like DuckDuckGo allow you to select your preferences based on what you want to see in the search results. In contrast, Yahoo allows you to set up personalized news and alerts. Make sure you take advantage of these features to have the ultimate search engine experience.

 There’s a clever trick, specifically if you’re using the  Now uncher, that allows you to use DuckDuckGo, Bing, or even searching directly in Firefox.  
 Here is the best way to live on the edge  ditch  search on your Android phone or tablet. 

 
## Get the  Now launcher


 The method I’m describing here works with the  Now uncher, which works on all Android devices running 4.1 lly Bean or above. The key feature here is that you can hold the home button  swipe up to go directly into search.  
 The specific action on your device may be different depending upon your soft or hardware button configuration.  
 Once you install another search app you’ll get a choice the next time you perform this action. Android will ask which app you wish to use. You can select an alternative for “just once” or “always,” which of course will make it the default. 
 One of the most interesting uses of this is with the Firefox browser. en you install the Firefox Android app, it adds in an option to launch Firefox search. This then takes you right into Firefox. If you have a specific search engine preference, however, you’ll then need to adjust that with the browser instead of the Android settings. 
 Note that the  search bar still remains dedicated to  search, even if you change the default search for the swipe-up action.  

 
## How to change it back to 


 en your experiment is over  you want to run back for the safe grassls of , you’ll need to reset your app preferences. 
 Head to Settings > Apps  then touch the specific app you want to change (the search app you chose instead of ). Then touch the “clear defaults” button. 
 If you want to completely mix things up  reset all of your defaults at once there’s a method for also. Again the settings, select apps from the device menu. Touch the three vertical buttons at the top right  select “reset app preferences.” 
 st remember that this won’t only reset your default search option. It will also change the default for your browser, music player, email program,  other apps. at this means is when you click a link, Android will ask if you want to open it with Chrome or any other browsers you have installed on your device. Only go this route if you don’t mind choosing default apps for a bunch of actions all over again.
