# Unlock the Ultimate PDF Hack: Merge PDFs on Any Device with Ease and Confidence!

As technology continues to evolve and become an essential part of our daily lives, we find ourselves relying on digital documents for everything, from work-related files to personal paperwork. PDFs, or Portable Document Files, have become the preferred file format for documents as they offer several benefits, such as easy sharing, high-quality printing, and security. However, working with PDFs can be frustrating, especially if you need to merge multiple files into one document. Fortunately, there are several hacks you can use to merge PDFs on any device with ease and confidence.

## Why Merge PDFs?

Before digging into the hacks, it's essential to understand why you might need to merge PDFs. Here are some reasons:

- You have multiple documents that need to be shared or printed as one file.
- You want to create a single document for easy navigation and reference.
- You have different versions of the same document that you want to merge.

Whatever the reason, merging PDFs can save you time and effort, especially if you're dealing with many files.

## The Conventional Way of Merging PDFs

Traditionally, merging PDFs required specialized software or a specific tool from a PDF editor. This method can be expensive, time-consuming, and not very user-friendly, especially for beginners. The good news is that you don't have to do it the old-fashioned way anymore.

## The Ultimate PDF Hack: Merge PDFs on Any Device with Ease and Confidence!

Nowadays, several hacks can help you merge PDFs without breaking a sweat. Here are some of the most popular and user-friendly options:

### 1. Use Online PDF Editors

Several online PDF editors allow you to merge PDFs without the need for specialized software. Most of these editors are free and offer a wide range of tools, including merging PDFs. These editors work in your web browser, meaning you don't need to install any software or download anything. Some notable online PDF editors include:

- Smallpdf
- PDFescape
- Sejda PDF

To merge PDFs using these editors, open the website and upload the files you want to merge. The editor will guide you through the merging process, and you'll have your merged PDFs within minutes.

### 2. Use Adobe Acrobat

If you have a subscription to Adobe Acrobat, merging PDFs is effortless. Adobe Acrobat is one of the most popular PDF editors and comes with a built-in tool for merging PDFs. Here's how to do it:

1. Open Adobe Acrobat and select the "Tools" option.
2. Choose "Combine Files" and then "Add Files."
3. Select the files you want to merge and click "Combine Files."
4. Save the new merged document.

### 3. Use Microsoft Word

If you don't have an Adobe Acrobat subscription, don't worry; you can still merge PDFs using Microsoft Word. While Word is not your typical PDF editor, it can be used to convert PDFs into Word documents, which can then be merged. Here's how to do it:

1. Open a new Word document and select the "Insert" option.
2. Choose "Object" and then "From File."
3. Select the PDF documents you want to merge and click "Insert."
4. Save the new merged document as a PDF.

## Final Thoughts

Merging PDFs can seem daunting at first, but with these hacks, it doesn't have to be. Whether you choose to use online PDF editors, Adobe Acrobat, or Microsoft Word, merging PDFs is doable on any device with ease and confidence. So next time you're faced with several PDF documents, don't stress; use one of these ultimate PDF hacks to merge your files quickly and smoothly.

If you've ever tried to do this in the past, you're probably aware that it wasn't a possibility through Adobe Acrobat unless you paid for a subscription. Back then, an internet search on the subject yielded several hundreds of websites advertising either the feature or an application you'd have to download and figure out how to use in order to get a seemingly simple task completed. 
Adobe Acrobat has finally simplified the process to combine PDFs into one, accompanied by a host of other options to edit, convert to PDFs and other file formats, sign, compress and split PDFs, all right on their website. These nifty features were added in the beginning of 2021 and are available with a free Adobe account, albeit with some limits to how many times they can be used. One of the positives of using this process is that it's available on Windows or Mac, since all you need is access to adobe.com from either Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari. Safari and Chrome are both also supported on mobile devices.
Probably the biggest bonus to this is that you don't have to download an application to complete the task, and don't have to worry as much about the dangers of data transaction with a possibly unverified third party, if privacy is one of your concerns.
You can find Mac-specific instructions at the end of this article, but to combine several PDFs on both Windows and Mac, you can go to adobe.com and click on PDF & E-signatures, then select Online Tools: Work with PDFs now (Figure 1).
Adobe will allow you to combine and download PDFs once without an account, but subsequent downloads will require you to sign in, so you can create a free account or sign in on the next step (Figure 2).
The list of tools available to your account includes Combine Files; click on that to start merging (Figure 3).
You should see an option to drag and drop your files or browse (Figure 4). Select the files you'd like to combine; you don't have to select them in order, you'll be able to rearrange the files in the next step.
Arrange the files in the order you'd like them to appear, then click on Combine (Figure 5).
Your file has been combined and is available to download (Figure 6).
When you sign in with an Adobe ID, you also have access to two free premium transactions every 30 days, so you're unfortunately limited to being able to combine PDFs only twice in a month. 
For Mac users, you can combine two or more PDFs into one through the Preview when you open the file. Here's how to do it on a Mac:
Open the PDF on your Mac and go to View, then Thumbnails (Figure 7).
The pages of the document should appear as thumbnails on the sidebar to the left. Go to Edit, then Insert > Page from File (Figure 8).
Find the document you'd like to add to the current one, then click Open (Figure 9).
You can rearrange the order of your pages, repeat the process to add more, or delete pages (Command+Delete). Once you're done, just go to File, then Export as PDF and you'll have the combined file as a result.
