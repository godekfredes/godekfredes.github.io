# Unlock Hidden Android Notification LED Settings with These Simple Tips!

If you own an Android device, you may have noticed a small LED light on it that flashes when you receive a new notification. This light is called the Notification LED, and it is a handy feature that can help you stay aware of incoming messages, calls, and notifications.

However, did you know that you can unlock hidden Android notification LED settings to customize your LED light to your liking? Here are some simple tips to help you unlock and tailor your notification LED settings.

## Tip 1: Check Your Device Settings

The first step to unlocking your Android notification LED settings is to check whether your device supports it. Not all Android phones have the same settings and features. To see if your phone has notification LED settings, go to your device's settings menu and look for a section labeled as Display, Sound, or Notifications. From there, you should see a notification LED option.

If you find the notification LED option, you can customize its behavior by selecting the color, pattern, and frequency of the flashing light for each app's notifications. If your phone does not have the notification LED option, don't worry. There are other solutions to help you access this feature.

## Tip 2: Install Third-Party Apps

If your phone lacks the built-in notification LED settings option, you can always download third-party apps to help you unlock hidden settings. Applications like Light Manager, LED Blinker Notifications, or NotifyBuddy allow you to customize the notification LED light on your device.

Typically, these apps are straightforward to set up and offer users a range of options to choose from. They usually list a defined set of apps for which you can adjust LED colors or patterns and let you create custom settings for other apps. Some apps even enable you to set a specific LED color or pattern for text messages, phone calls, social media applications like Facebook, and other types of notifications.

## Tip 3: Use ADB Commands

If your phone has the necessary hardware but lacks the notification LED settings option in its software, you can also use Android Debug Bridge (ADB) commands to enable this feature. ADB is a tool that developers use to connect to and debug Android devices.

Here's how you can use ADB commands to unlock hidden Android notification LED settings:

1. First, enable developer options on your device. To do this, go to Settings > About phone or tablet. Then tap on 'Build number' until you see a message that says you are now a developer.

2. Connect the device to your computer via USB cable.

3. Open Command Prompt on your computer and navigate to the folder where the ADB tool is installed.

4. Type the following command: adb devices. This will show your Android device is connected.

5. Next, type the command: adb shell settings put system notification_light_pulse 1. This will turn on the notification LED.

6. Finally, adjust the LED light color, pattern, and frequency by using an app like Light Flow to customize your notification settings.

In conclusion, customizing your Android notification LED settings can help you stay up-to-date with incoming notifications in a fun and personalized way. Whether you have built-in settings or choose to download apps or utilize ADB commands, there are a variety of ways to customize your device's LED notifications to your liking.
