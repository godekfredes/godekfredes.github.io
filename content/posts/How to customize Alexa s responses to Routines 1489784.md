Revolutionize Your Alexa Experience with These Customized Routine Responses!

Alexa has become an integral part of our lives, offering convenient assistance and a wide range of skills to make our daily tasks easier. However, have you ever wished Alexa could do more for you or respond to your queries in more specific ways? Well, with customized routine responses, you can revolutionize your Alexa experience, making it more personalized and efficient than ever before!

Customized routine responses enable you to create personalized voice commands that Alexa can respond to with a specific action. For instance, if you created a routine response "Good morning Alexa," you could instruct Alexa to play a specific radio station or provide you with news updates at that specific time. Here's how you can use customized routine responses to revolutionize your Alexa experience.

Create Personalized Wake-Up Calls

With customized routine responses, you can make your Alexa wake up calls more personalized and inviting. Create a customized response command for Alexa to greet you with your name every morning, followed by your favorite song, news updates or the day's weather forecast.

Control Your Smart Home with Ease

If you have smart home devices like smart bulbs, plugs, or thermostats, Alexa customized routine responses can make it easier for you to control them. Design and create a custom routine response for Alexa to switch off or dim the lights in a specific room in your house, adjust the thermostat when the temperature changes, or turn off a specific plug.

Order From Restaurants and Grocery Stores via Alexa

Alexa custom routine responses can also help you to order your favorite meal from a restaurant or grocery store without lifting a finger. Create a routine response for Alexa to do all of the ordering for you with just a few custom spoken commands. "Alexa, order my usual pizza from Domino's" or "Alexa, order my grocery delivery from Amazon Fresh" can save you time and hassle.

Get Daily Inspirational Quotes

If you require daily motivation, you can create an Alexa routine response to provide you with daily inspirational messages. You can customize the routine response to greet you every morning with your favorite motivational quote.

In conclusion, customized routine responses can revolutionize your Alexa experience, making daily routines more personalized and efficient than ever before. The possibilities are endless when it comes to creating customized commands for Alexa. Incorporate these actions to make Alexa do more of what you need and enjoy a smarter home.

More: How to change Alexa's voice
Sure, you can just let her give her standard "Ok" response, but that's boring. Instead, why not create a response like the one I use for my Solar Flare Routine? This hyperbolic-sounding command turns up all of the lights around my desk to max brightness for when I need to do detailed work. But the best part is when Alexa says "Shade thine eyes!" every time I run it. Want to know how to pull off some equally nerdy tricks? Read on.

 
## How to change Alexa's response to routines
 
Materials needed: A smartphone with the Alexa app installed, any Echo smart speaker or smart display
 
Estimated time: 1-2 minutes
 
### Step 1: Open the Alexa app and create a new routine, or edit an existing one


Either create a new routine (by tapping the + at the top right of the Routines page) or open one of your existing routines. In both cases, you'll need to tap on the last of the three primary options: Add Action. This section allows you to add smart home functions, briefings, communications actions, media controls, and much more. Most important, it's also the section where you can control how Alexa responds when you run the Routine you're editing. 

 
### Step 2: Open the Alexa Says menu
 
### Step 3: Choose your response phrase


Within this menu, you'll be able to choose from a wide selection of premade responses Alexa can give anytime you activate a Routine. These range from simple options like "Good morning" or "Good night" to having Alexa tell you a joke or a fun fact to welcoming you home at the end of a long day. There's also a section called "Phrases" (seen above), where you can find more event-specific options for each of the aforementioned scenarios as well as for occasions like birthdays. Any of these are available for any Routine you'd like to create or edit.

 
### Step 3a (optional): Create your own response


If none of the pre-made responses suit your needs or if you just want to get creative or prank your family and friends, you may want to customize your own response. To do this, simply tap the Customized option on the Alexa Says screen and type in what you'd like Alexa to say in response. Your response can be any phrase up to 250 characters. If you're wondering (let's be real, you are wondering), you can't make Alexa curse. Any profanities you use will be bleeped out. Aside from the character cap and self-censorship, the only limit is your creativity. 

 
### Step 4: Confirm your chosen response and save your Routine


Once you've entered your chosen response and hit the Next button, you'll see the Confirm screen shown above. This will give you one last look at exactly what Alexa will say before adding the response to your Routine. If you'd like to change something about it, you can go back using the < in the top left of the display. If you're happy with it, tap Next (circled in red) to return to the main page of the Routine you're editing. Once you're there, just remember to hit Save (on the top-right of the display) if you were creating a new routine, or hit the < (if you were editing an existing routine) before exiting the app. Doing this saves your new response to the Routine. Note: it sometimes takes up to a minute before any new Routines or edited Routines will play correctly from your Echo smart speakers and displays.

Have Alexa recite your Wi-Fi password - This one can be handy if you frequently have guests over for a few days and they keep hounding you to remind them of the password. Just set up a routine with your password as a customized response. Alexa can easily recite individual letters and numbers, but you'll have to type out the names of special characters (exclamation points and ampersands, for instance). Of course, be careful with this one. Don't use it outside your home, or when someone you wouldn't trust with access to your network is present.
Amaze your kids, or anyone else, with a personalized response - Kids usually love chatting with Alexa. We've all seen viral videos of youngsters being amazed when the little cylinder lights up and talks back. Imagine how shocked they'll be if Alexa gives them a truly personalized response. Just tell them to ask your Echo device whatever question you've set up to trigger the routine and have Alexa reply with a customized response that's tailored specifically for them. You can even include their name. This works equally well if you'd like to prank your friends or relatives by setting it up for one of their existing, commonly used request.
Provide a bit of basic tech support to an elderly relative - Many of you reading this are likely the first call your parents or grandparents make when that dang TV is just showing static or their smartphone suddenly stopped ringing when a call comes in. If there's a particular question you keep getting asked over and over again, turn it into a routine. Just let them know they can ask Alexa next time and set up her reply with something like, "Press the Input button on the remote and choose HDMI 1" or "Check to see if the little switch on the top left of your phone is showing an orange dot. If so, flip it the other way" Alexa won't complain, no matter how many times they ask.
If you open the Your Routines section of the Alexa app, you'll notice each routine has a circular, blue play icon to the right of it. Tapping that on any Routine with a response included in it will pop up a window asking which device you'd like the response to play from. You can tap any available device and Alexa's pre-programmed response will play through it.
