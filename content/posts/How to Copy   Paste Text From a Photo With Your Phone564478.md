Once you have downloaded and installed the app on your phone, you can use it to copy text from pictures by following these simple steps:

Step 1: Open the Google Lens app and point your phone camera at the picture containing the text you want to copy.

Step 2: The app will automatically recognize the text and highlight it on the screen. You can then tap on the text to select it.

Step 3: Once you have selected the text, you can copy it to your clipboard and paste it wherever you like.

Google Lens is not the only app that can perform OCR on images. Other popular apps include Microsoft Office Lens, Text Scanner OCR, and CamScanner. These apps are also available for free and offer similar features.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, copying text from pictures on your phone is no longer a hassle thanks to OCR technology and apps like Google Lens. By following the simple steps outlined above, you can now easily extract text from pictures and copy it to your clipboard. This insider hack will undoubtedly make your phone a text-copying wizard and save you time and effort in the long run.
