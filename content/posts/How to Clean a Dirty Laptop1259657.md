Revive Your Laptop's Life with this One Simple Cleaning Hack - You Won't Recognize it After This!

Are you tired of laptops that lag, freeze, and just don't perform as they used to when you first bought them? Fear not, because there is a simple solution that can breathe new life into your old device. All you need is a cleaning hack that is so easy and effective, your laptop will look and feel brand new again.

Why Do Laptops Need Cleaning?

As we use our laptops, they accumulate dust, dirt, and debris over time. This buildup can lead to overheating, slow performance, hardware damage, and even system failure. Even if you keep your laptop in a clean and dust-free environment, the natural process of aging and daily use will cause it to gather unwanted dust and germs.

Cleaning your laptop regularly helps to remove this buildup, improve its performance, and extend its longevity. Neglecting to do so can result in costly repairs, or worse yet, the need to replace the entire device.

The Simple Cleaning Hack

The first and most important step is to turn off your laptop and unplug it from the power source. You do not want to risk damaging any hardware components or electrocuting yourself while cleaning.

Next, gather a microfiber cloth, a soft-bristled brush, and a can of compressed air. While some people may recommend using water or cleaning solutions, they can be risky as any liquid spills can cause permanent damage to your laptop's delicate internal components.

Using the soft-bristled brush, gently sweep across the keyboard, touchpad, and screen to remove any loose debris. Be careful not to apply too much pressure or force, as this can scratch or damage the laptop's sensitive surfaces.

Once you have removed any loose debris, use the compressed air can to blow away any remaining dust and dirt particles. Be sure to hold the can upright and not to shake it during use. Direct the nozzle towards the keyboard, fan vents, and any other gaps or crevices where dirt may have settled.

Finally, use the microfiber cloth to wipe down the outer casing, screen, and keyboard. This will not only remove any remaining dust but will also help to sanitize the laptop's surfaces by killing bacteria and germs.

The Result

Once you have completed the cleaning hack, you will notice a significant difference in your laptop's performance and appearance. It will work faster, cooler, and quieter than before. Moreover, you will be able to see and feel the difference in its cleanliness.

Conclusion

In summary, cleaning your laptop is essential to its performance, longevity, and your overall user experience. Regularly taking care of your device not only keeps it running smoothly but also saves you money and hassle from costly repairs or replacements.

So, set aside just a few minutes of your day to give your laptop the cleaning treatment it deserves. With this simple cleaning hack, you can easily revive your laptop's life and experience it's like brand new all over again.

Now cleaning your laptop may seem like a daunting task but don’t let that hinder you. After all, having a freshly cleaned device may help you fall in love with your five-year-old MacBook all over again. It is also useful to know how to properly clean laptops if you buy or sell used computers since the previous owners don’t always leave their laptops in the best condition.
Ready to begin? Keep reading below for our tips and tricks for making your laptop look as good as new.

 
## Step one: Gather your supplies


You don’t need any fancy, overpriced cleaners to give your laptop a well-deserved makeover. In fact, you may already have the necessary tools at your home. We recommend using simple supplies like cotton swabs, rubbing alcohol, microfiber cloths, and pressurized air.

 
## Step two: Start from the inside


While it may be tempting to start with the keyboard or screen, cleaning experts insist on starting with the inside of your laptop. You can use a can of compressed air to clean out any crumbs, dust, or pet hair that may have become lodged inside your laptop.
Begin by taking the can of compressed air and blowing quick bursts of air into the keyboard, USB ports, and vents. Avoid long sprays, as the air can cause moisture to accumulate inside your device, which may cause damage to the fans.
As long as you do not see any dust bunnies in the vents of your laptop, there shouldn’t be a need to open up your device. If you are a smoker or you have pets, you may want to clean the inside of your laptop more often since you are more likely to see a much quicker build-up of smoke, hair, and dust. If you’re worried that your laptop reeks of cigarette smoke or other foul odors, you can use kitty litter to rid your device of those unwanted smells.
Just seal your laptop in a bag with a cup of kitty litter for 24-48 hours. Most kitty litter formulas have active charcoal as one of their main ingredients and the charcoal acts as an odor eliminator. If you’re feeling brave, you can also take your computer apart and clean off the board with isopropyl alcohol, as this may also help neutralize any unwanted smells.

 
## Step three: Tackle the outside


Once you have successfully rid the inside of your laptop of dust and other particles, it is time to clean the outside of your device. The first rule of thumb to follow when cleaning any electronic device is to avoid spraying any sort of chemical directly onto the surface.
Instead, spray rubbing alcohol onto a microfiber cloth, wring any excess solution from the cloth, and then use the cloth to wipe the exterior of your laptop. You can also use cotton swabs moistened with rubbing alcohol to clean around the keys of your keyboard.
If there are any spots on your laptop that are hard to remove, cleaning experts suggest using a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser; however, these should be used sparingly because they are very abrasive and may remove the natural finish of your device. You should also avoid using any household cleaners containing ammonia or alkaline. This means no Windex on the laptop screen despite how tempting that may be!
And there you have it folks, just follow these simple steps and you can rekindle the love for your old laptop in no time! Happy cleaning!
