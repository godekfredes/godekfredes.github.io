# Unlock the Skies: Build the Ultimate Windows Flight Simulator Setup and Soar to New Heights!

As a flight enthusiast or a commercial pilot, there's something inexplicably gratifying about being up in the air, soaring above the clouds while in control of a powerful aircraft. However, getting access to a cockpit is not always as easy as one would like, especially for flight aficionados that do not have the luxury of access to real planes or flight simulators.

Thankfully, with the ever-growing capabilities of technology, we can adequately replicate the virtual experience of flying, through flight simulators, which can provide a realistic flying experience. Furthermore, users can even obtain the sensation of flying with their personalized setup, optimized for delivering an immersive and authentic experience that mimics a real cockpit perfectly.

In this article, we will highlight some tips for building the ultimate Windows flight simulator setup, which can help unlock the skies and enable you to soar to new heights like a pro.

## Hardware Considerations

One of the most significant investments required to build a top-notch Windows flight simulator setup is hardware. Here are some of the essential equipment you will need:

### Computer

The computer you use plays a vital role in the overall functionality of your simulator setup. The three things that matter when selecting a computer are the graphics card, memory, and processor. A powerful processor will make sure that the computer can run any software, while a high-end graphics card will offer you more details and better resolution in the game. Additional memory will also help boost the game's performance and reduce issues of lag.

### Monitors

Investing in quality monitors is essential, as they are an integral part of the simulation experience. Ideal monitors for simulators are the curved and widescreen monitors that provide realistic views, giving the user a broader field of view.

### Flight Controls, Cockpit, and Chair

Invest in quality controls, cockpits, and chairs that replicate a real cockpit's experience. Flight controls like yokes and pedals, when combined with the cockpit, will make it feel like you're flying a real aircraft. Choose a chair designed for flight simulator setups to make it more comfortable and ergonomic.

## Software Considerations

After investing in the hardware, the software is the next essential addition that determines the functionality and overall experience. Here are some of the software to add to your simulator setup:

### Flight Simulator

The flight simulator is the primary software that makes the simulation experience possible. Choose the software that has the best graphics, user interface, and functionality. Microsoft Flight Simulator is the most popular flight simulator globally, with realistic gaming features.

### Scenery

The scenery is the backdrop of the simulator and plays a crucial role in providing a realistic experience. Adding high-quality scenery add-ons with realistic features like terrain, weather elements, landing strips, and other visual details will help bring your simulator to life.

### Weather Add-Ons

Add-Ons are essential software that adds features that enhance the gaming experience. Weather add-ons simulate the real aspects of weather, changing wind speeds and directions, turbulence, and various weather elements. Weather add-ons that support real-time weather patterns will provide users with an immersive experience.

In conclusion, building a top-notch simulator setup is not an easy task, requiring a lot of investment in both hardware and software. However, once you have assembled all the necessary equipment and programs, you will have an immersive simulation experience that offers an unparalleled sensation of flying. So, whether you're a budding pilot or just an aviation enthusiast, the ultimate Windows flight simulator setup will be your chance to unlock the skies and soar to new heights.

You will need other flight-appropriate gear to help you take flight, though. We want you to be able to soar with the birds from the safety of your own home, not an airline seat. Microsoft has made that possible with the newest update to its Flight Simulator. Tap or click here to check it out.
You can use Microsoft’s Flight Simulator with the basic computer components you have, but if you really want to take your journey across the jungles and cities of the world, you may want to invest in some new equipment instead. 

 
## The basic requirements for Flight Simulator


You’re going to need some basic computer equipment to immerse yourself in flight simulator. 
The minimum system requirements for Flight Simulator 2020 include:

 
64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 10Processor: Intel i5-4460 or AMD Ryzen 3 1200Memory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: Radeon RX 570 or GeForce GTX 770 DirectX: Version 11Available storage: 150 GB


Those basic system requirements will let you get off the ground, but if you really want to take flight, you’re probably going to need to upgrade at least a few of those components. 

 
## How to build the perfect Flight Simulator setup
 
### Graphics card


One of the most important factors in creating the ultimate Flight Simulator setup is your graphics card. You want to have the right graphics card to provide the immersive experience you’re looking for. Microsoft recommends the Nvidia GTX 970 graphics card, but these cards are a bit older and aren’t readily available. 
We recommend the GeForce GTX 1660 OC 6G Graphics Card as a smart alternative to the Nvidia GTX 970 to upgrade your graphics and truly create the ultimate flight simulator setup. This graphics card offers NVIDIA Turing architecture with advanced graphics and the GeForce Experience, which lets you livestream, capture and share high-quality videos and screenshots.
It’s integrated with a 6GB GDDR5 192-bit memory interface and the WINDFORCE 2X Cooling System with alternate spinning fans keeps your system at the right temp to speed up your gaming.

 
### Multiple monitors


We recommend this triple-stand monitor mount, which can fit three flat or curved computer monitors ranging in size from 17- to 32-inches. Each arm can hold up to 17.6 lbs, and it won’t take up a ton of desk space. 
For your two extra monitors, we recommend investing in this frameless monitor, which has the thinnest bezel and 144Hz refresh rate. It’s also Gsync compatible, which means there will be no screen tearing, as the frames displayed on the monitor are synced with the output of the graphics card. 
If you don’t have room for a three-monitor setup, you can always opt for an ultra-widescreen monitor instead. We recommend the mSi 2560 x 1080 UltraWide Curved Gaming monitor for gamers with limited desk space. This monitor has a curved gaming display and FHD high resolution that allows you to truly immerse yourself in Flight Simulator. 
You’ll feel like you’re truly preparing for liftoff with the FHD resolution, and the 1 millisecond response time eliminates screen tearing and choppy frame rates while the AMD FreeSync prevents screen tearing. 

 
### Flight Yoke system


If you want to get the feel of being a pilot, you need a realistic flight yoke system. We recommend the Logitech G Pro Flight Yoke System, which offers realistic flight yoke controls and a stainless steel yoke shaft. This flight yoke system also offers a POV Hat, 14 button controls, and 3-position mode switch to give you the option of at least 54 programmable controls to make the most of your virtual aircraft. 
As a bonus, it also has a two-position desk clamp to keep your flight yoke in the cockpit, and not on the ground from hitting it with your forearm.

 
### Flight rudder pedals


You’re also going to want to invest in some flight rudder peddles before taking flight. We like the Logitech G PRO Flight Rudder Pedals, which are self-centering, nonslip pedals with adjustable damping and footrests that adjust to fit all sizes.
These offer precise rudder and braking control and tension adjustment to suit the way you fly. Plus, these pedals use Saitek Smart Technology programming software, which allows you to configure the controls to suit your flight and space simulation gaming style. 

 
### Instruments for the enthusiast


If you’re really into flight simulation, you may also want to invest in the RealSimGear G1000 Suite for X-Plane and P3D. The RealSimGear G1000 Suite is a high quality, ultra-realistic hardware interface for your flight sim. 
This suite includes the G1000 PFD, MFD and GMA audio panel, and the system connects to your PC via a USB cable — no configuration necessary. Plus, it comes pre-loaded with the RealSimGear drivers for easy plug and play operation. It can be mounted into an existing panel or used with the optional desktop stand — though you’ll have to purchase that separately.

 
### IR tracker 


If you want to fully dip your head into the game, you may want to consider investing in an IR tracker. We recommend the Tracklr 5 Premium Head Tracking for Gaming, which you wear on a hat to control your point of view by moving your head in any direction.
This IR tracker will make it feel like you’re looking down on the planet from the windows of your cockpit, and lets you know exactly where you are sitting, leaning, and looking in true 3d space. This particular IR tracker gives you a field of view that’s 51.7 degrees and has a super-fast response time of 9 milliseconds.
