Discover the Sneaky Trick to Determine Whether Your Windows 11 is Genuine or a Counterfeit Copy in Seconds!

As the popularity of Windows 11 continues to soar, so does the number of counterfeit copies. Although Microsoft has made efforts to combat piracy, counterfeiters continue to find ways to create fake copies of the operating system.

It is, therefore, essential to know whether your Windows 11 is legitimate or a counterfeit copy. Fortunately, there is a sneaky trick that you can use to determine its authenticity in seconds.

Firstly, open the Start menu and click on "Settings." Next, navigate to "Update & Security" and click on "Activation."

If your Windows 11 is genuine, you will see a message that says "Windows is activated with a digital license." This means that your Windows 11 copy is authentic and has been verified by Microsoft's servers.

However, if your Windows 11 is not genuine, you will see a message that says "We can't activate Windows on this device right now. You can try activating again later or go to the Store to buy genuine Windows."

This message indicates that your copy of the operating system is counterfeit and has not been verified by Microsoft's servers. It is essential to note that counterfeit copies may have malware or other security issues that can compromise your data and device.

In conclusion, using the sneaky trick above, you can easily determine whether your Windows 11 copy is genuine or a counterfeit in a matter of seconds. If your copy is counterfeit, it is advisable to purchase a legitimate copy from a verified retailer to ensure your data and device's safety.
