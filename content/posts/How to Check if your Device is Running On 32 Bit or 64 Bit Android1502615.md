# Is your Android Device Slow? The Reason Might Shock You! Learn How to Check if Your Device is Running on 32 or 64 Bit! 

If your Android device seems to be running slower than usual, there could be a reason you never even considered. It's possible that your device is running on its 32-bit architecture instead of the modern 64-bit system. But what does that mean, and how can you check?

## The Difference between 32 and 64 Bit

Every computer, including your smartphone or tablet, has an architecture that determines how it can process information. The main difference between 32 and 64-bit architectures comes down to what's known as "addressable memory."

A 32-bit architecture can only address 4 GB of memory. This means that if you have a device running on 32-bit architecture and you try to use more than 4 GB of memory, it will start to slow down because it simply can't handle that much information. In contrast, a 64-bit architecture is capable of addressing much more memory, up to 16 exabytes.

## How to Check if Your Device is Running on 32 or 64 Bit

To check if your Android device is running on a 32 or 64-bit architecture, follow these simple steps:

1. Open your device's Settings app.
2. Scroll down and tap on "About Phone".
3. Look for the "Android Version" section and tap on it.
4. On the next screen, you should see a line that says "Build Number". Tap on it about 7 times in quick succession.
5. You should now see a message that says "You are now a Developer!"
6. Go back to the main Settings menu and tap on "Developer options".
7. Scroll down to find the "Select runtime" option.
8. Tap on it to see if your device is running on 32 or 64-bit architecture.

If your device is running on 32-bit architecture, you may want to consider upgrading to a device that supports a 64-bit system. It's not just about being able to handle more memory, but also about being able to take advantage of modern features and improvements that come with a 64-bit architecture.

## Conclusion

If you're experiencing slow performance on your Android device, it might be due to the fact that it's running on a 32-bit architecture. By checking your device's runtime, you can determine whether or not it's time to upgrade to a more modern device with a 64-bit system.

Don't let your old device hold you back! Upgrade to a modern smartphone or tablet that can keep up with your demands and enjoy faster, smoother performance than ever before.

With the improvements in hardware architecture, we are now seeing these terms used even on Android devices. Smartphones with 32-bit and 64-bit processors aren’t a new thing. They have been around for a few years now, and we don’t care to know about the architecture used in a smartphone processor, which is the main thing to impact the device’s performance.
In short and simple words, a 64-bit processor is more capable than a 32-bit processor. It is because a 64-bit processor can fetch and handle more data at once. So, now the important question is, ‘Is my device running a 32 or 64bit operating system?’.
Well, if a 64-bit processor powers your Android device, it will be running on a 64-bit version of Android. Similarly, if it’s using a 32-bit processor, it will likely have a 32-bit version of Android. For more details, check out the article Difference Between 32-bit and 64-bit Smartphones.

 
## Check if your device is running on 32-bit or 64-bit Android.


If you are about to side-load an app on your Android device, you should know whether the app will be compatible with your device or not. The Apk file that you download will be compatible with only the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Android.
Below, we have shared a detailed guide on checking if your device is 32-bit or 64-bit. Let’s check out.
Step 1. First of all, head to the Google Play Store and download the ‘AIDA64‘ app.

Step 2. Now open the app. You will now a screen like below. Simply tap on the ‘CPU’ option.

Step 3. Under the CPU, you need to check the ‘Instruction Set’ option. This tells about the CPU architecture used on your device.

Step 4. If you want to check if your phone is using 64 or 32bit Android, tap on the ‘Android’ option.

Step 5. Under the Android, look at the ‘Kernel Architecture’ field. It tells you if your device is 32-bit or 64-bit.

That’s it! You are done. This is how you can check if an Android device is 64-bit or 32-bit.
So, this article is all about how to check if an Android device is 64-bit or 32-bit. I hope this article helped you! Please share it with your friends also. If you have any doubts related to this, let us know in the comment box below.
