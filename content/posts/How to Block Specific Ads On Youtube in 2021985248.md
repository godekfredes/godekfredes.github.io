YouTube is the most popular video-sharing platform around the world, with over 2 billion monthly active users.

These ads are not only disruptive but also consume precious data and time. But there is good news – there are ways to block these ads for a seamless and interruption-free video-watching experience. In this article, we will discuss how to block ads on YouTube in 2021.

Use AdBlock or uBlock

AdBlock and uBlock are the most popular extensions that help block ads from websites, including YouTube. These extensions work by analyzing and blocking scripts and content that display ads. Installing these extensions is easy – just head to the Chrome Web Store and search for AdBlock or uBlock Origin. Once downloaded, the extension will start blocking ads on YouTube automatically. However, some ads may still slip through the cracks. If this happens, you can report the ad to the extension developer and they will fix it in the next update.

YouTube Premium

YouTube Premium is a subscription-based service that offers an ad-free video watching experience. It also provides other benefits such as access to exclusive content, the ability to download videos for offline viewing, and the option to play videos while using other apps. YouTube Premium is available in different plans and prices depending on your location, and you can enjoy a free trial period for 30 days.

YouTube Vanced

YouTube Vanced is an unofficial version of the YouTube app that offers ad-blocking, background playback, and other features not available in the official app. This app is not available on Google Play Store, but can be downloaded from the official website. It is also available in two versions – rooted and non-rooted. The non-rooted version is easier to install and can be used on any Android phone. However, to use the rooted version, your device needs to be rooted, which is a complex process and can damage your device if not done correctly.

Pi-hole

Pi-hole is a network-wide ad-blocking service that blocks ads across all devices connected to the network, including on YouTube. It works by blacklisting ad servers and preventing them from displaying ads on any device connected to the network. Pi-hole requires a Raspberry Pi board and some technical know-how to set up, but once installed, it provides a seamless ad-free experience on all devices.
