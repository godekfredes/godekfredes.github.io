# Unlock Hidden Navic Features on Your Android Device: Here's How to Check if Your Phone is Compatible!

Android devices have come a long way since their inception, and one of the newest features in recent times is NavIC support. NavIC stands for Navigation with Indian Constellation, and it is India's own satellite navigation system. It is similar to other satellite navigation systems like GPS, Galileo, and GLONASS, but with a few added advantages.

NavIC provides considerable benefits, such as improved location accuracy, especially in built-up areas and forests, and is also beneficial in terms of strategic and defence needs. However, most Android devices come pre-installed with GPS and GLONASS without including NavIC support. But, worry not, as we'll walk you through the process of unlocking NavIC features on your Android device.

## Step 1: Check for Compatibility

Before trying to unlock NavIC features, it's essential to see if your smartphone is compatible with the NavIC system. At present, only select devices support NavIC technology. The list of NavIC supported devices includes:

- Xiaomi Redmi Note 9
- Poco X2
- Realme X3 SuperZoom
- Realme Narzo 30 Pro
- Samsung Galaxy F41

If you don't have any of these devices, try checking if your mobile has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 series or higher Processor chipset. Devices with Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 series or higher processors support NavIC technology.

## Step 2: Enable NavIC on Your Device

Once you have confirmed that your mobile is compatible with NavIC, download the "GPSTest" app from Google Play Store. This application helps to identify the navigation systems on your device. Verify that your device supports "NavIC" by following these steps:

- Launch the GPSTest app and click on "Menu" (three dots) on the right corner of the app screen.
- Click on 'Settings."
- Scroll down and locate the "Position" tab and tap on it.
- Tap on "Satellite systems."
- Finally, check the box beside NavIC.

NavIC will now be visible on your device under satellite systems. Once you enable NavIC, your device can use multiple navigation systems such as GPS, GLONASS, BEIDOU, and NavIC simultaneously.

## Step 3: Verify NavIC is Working

To verify that NavIC is working correctly, you can conduct a test by following these steps:

- Make sure you are outdoors.
- Launch the GPSTest app continuously. Tap on the "Signal graphs" menu option in GPSTest.
- Check the Satellite system graphs and observe the NavIC signal quality. If you're getting more than four satellites for NavIC along with signal quality, your device successfully supports NavIC.

## Conclusion

That's it! You've successfully unlocked NavIC features on your compatible Android device. You can now experience the benefits provided by the NavIC system such as improved accuracy, better signal quality, etc. Remember, this feature could vary based on your device's software patch level or custom ROM. For the best user experience, we advise you to update your device with the latest software available for your device.

NavIC is considered to be at par with the US-based GPS, and it’s expected to provide a position accuracy of better than 20 meters in the primary service area. To be honest, NavIC is supposed to become India’s GPS alternative.
Recently, the Chinese smartphone maker Realme has launched a new 5G smartphone in India known as Realme X50 Pro. The smartphone has India’s Navigation system NavIC. Since it’s a new technology, only a few smartphones would support NavIC.

 
### Smartphones with NavIC support


Right now, the smartphones which are running on Snapdragon 460, 662, and 720G have support for NavIC. So, if you are willing to use India’s navigation system, make sure to purchase a phone which has any of these chipsets.
Although Snapdragon 765 and Snapdragon 865 is also compatible with NavIC, the service is yet to be enabled.

 
## How To Check If Your Phone Has NavIC Support


Well, if you don’t know your phone’s chipset, then you can rely upon this method to check if your phone has NavIC support or Not. Follow some of the simple steps given below to check if your phone has NavIC support.
Step 1. First of all, download & install GNSTest on your Android smartphone.
Step 2. Once installed, open the app and you will see a screen like below.
Step 3. Here you need to tap on the ‘Sky’ button and then tap on the ‘Start’ test.
Step 4. If the app detects all Navigation satellites, then your phone has the NavIC support. If it doesn’t recognize any or shows you an error, then your phone is incompatible with NavIC.
