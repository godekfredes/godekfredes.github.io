In Summary


Many people prefer playing games on their PCs or phones using a gaming/console controller instead of keyboards or touch screens.
But it’s not as easy as plugging your favorite gaming controller to your phone or PC and start playing.
In this guide, we are going to have a look at different types of controllers and how you can connect to them easily.








 
## What is a Gaming Console Controller?


Gaming Controller is a gadget we use on different devices for gaming. Generally, all gaming controllers come with joysticks through which we can provide various input in different types of games. Many people prefer controllers over keyboards or touch screens because of their ergonomic design. Furthermore, physical buttons offer a better experience when compared to playing games using touch. A gaming controller can be easily held with two hands and offer huge flexibility. These controllers come with numerous buttons (including the shoulder buttons), which quickly perform various tasks in a game.

 
## Different types of Gaming Controllers


There are many kinds of gaming controllers available today. Some are specific to the popular consoles, while others are generic ones capable of pairing with multiple devices. Let’s take a look.

 
### 1. Generic USB controllers



Generic USB controllers, as the name suggests, are the controllers that work over USB. These controllers connect to your smartphone using a USB OTG cable.

What about latency? As these types of controllers work over cable, the next time you are in an intense situation in Call of Duty, latency should not be an issue. Furthermore, such types of controllers cost comparatively less compared to their Bluetooth counterparts.
