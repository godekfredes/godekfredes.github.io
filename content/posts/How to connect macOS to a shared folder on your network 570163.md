Unlock Top Secret Files: The Ultimate Guide to Connecting Your MacOS to a Shared Network Folder!

Are you tired of emailing files back and forth between your co-workers? Are you tired of being the only person who has access to important files? Fear not, for you can now connect your macOS to a shared network folder. With this guide, you will be able to share files with your co-workers and access important files with ease.

Step 1: Connect to the Network

The first step to connecting your macOS to a shared network folder is to connect to the network. Go to the Apple Menu and choose “System Preferences.” Select “Network” and choose your preferred network connection. You can connect to the network either via Ethernet or Wi-Fi.

Step 2: Locate the Shared Folder

Once you are connected to the network, you will need to locate the shared folder. You can do this by clicking on “Finder” on your macOS and select “Go” from the menu bar. Choose “Connect to Server” and enter the server address, which will be provided by the system administrator.

Step 3: Connect to the Shared Folder

Once you have located the shared folder, select it and click on “Connect.” You will be prompted to enter your username and password. Enter these details to gain access to the shared folder.

Step 4: Access the Shared Folder

After you have successfully connected to the shared folder, you can access the files inside by simply clicking on the folder. You can then retrieve or modify any files inside the shared folder.

Step 5: Make Changes to the Shared Folder

If you are the system administrator or have the authority to make changes to the shared folder, you can make changes by right-clicking on the folder and selecting “Get Info.” You can then change the permissions or add users to the shared folder.

In conclusion, connecting your macOS to a shared network folder is an easy process that will allow you to access important files and share files with your co-workers. You can now collaborate on projects without having to worry about security risks or having to send files back and forth via email. Follow these simple steps, and you will be sharing and accessing files with ease in no time!

To make this work, you'll need four things: 
Here's how it works. Olivia works on machine A and has a folder called Public that is shared out to the network. The Public folder is configured in such a way that a special account (named guest) has access to the folder. Anyone on the LAN (who has the credentials for the guest account) will be able to access the contents of that folder. Depending on how Olivia has configured access, those users might only have read access or they might have full read/write access. 
Once upon a time (back in macOS v 10 and earlier) you use to be able to view all machines on your network but that feature is no more. In its place, you must manually connect to each server from within Finder. That's what we're going to do now.

 
A shared directory on your networkThe IP address of the computer hosting the shared directoryA user account that can access the share (unless the share is configured for anonymous access)A device running macOS.


Let's make this connection.

 
## Connecting macOS to a network share
 
### 1. Open Finder


The first step is to log into your device and open Finder (the macOS file manager). With Finder open (Figure 1), click the Go menu entry.

 
### 2. Open the Connect to Server window


From the Go menu (Figure 2), click Connect to Server.

 
### 3. Connect to the server


In the top text field (Figure 3), type the address of the server in the form of smb://SERVER (where SERVER is the IP address of the server hosting the share). For example, if the host IP address is 192.168.1.62, you'd type smb://192.168.1.62.
Click Connect and a new window will appear asking you to verify you want to connect to the server (Figure 4). 
Click Connect and you will then be prompted to enter the share credentials (Figure 5).
Click Registered User and then type the username and password for the user associated with the share and click Connect.
If there are multiple shared directories on that server, you'll then be prompted to select which one you want to use (Figure 6).
Once you've successfully authenticated, Finder will open with the contents of the shared directory so you can start working with the files.
And that's all there is to connect to a network share from macOS. Enjoy all that glorious access to those directories on your LAN.
