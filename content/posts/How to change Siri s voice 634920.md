Revamp Your Siri Experience: Learn How To Change Siri's Voice Easily!

Siri has become an integral part of our lives. It has made things easier, from setting reminders to answering questions, and even making calls. However, there is still something that could make the Siri experience more personalized, and that is its voice. Did you know that you can choose from different Siri voices? That's right, and it's easy to do. Here's how you can change Siri's voice to suit your preferences.

Step 1: Access the Siri settings

First, open your device's Settings app, and look for the section labeled Siri & Search. Tap on it, and then select the Siri Voice option.

Step 2: Choose your preferred voice

The Siri Voice menu will display all the available voices you can choose from. These include male and female voices, as well as regional accents. You can listen to each option by tapping on the Play button beside it. Once you have decided on a voice, just tap on it to select it.

Step 3: Customize Siri's language and dialect

In addition to choosing a different voice, you can also customize Siri's language and dialect. This is particularly helpful for people who speak multiple languages or prefer a specific regional dialect. Simply select the Language option in the Siri & Search settings and choose your preferred language and dialect.

Step 4: Test your new Siri voice

After making your selection, it's time to test out your new Siri voice. Activate Siri by holding down the home button on your iPhone or saying "Hey Siri" if you have the feature enabled. You'll hear your new selected voice as Siri responds to your commands.

Changing Siri's voice is an easy way to make your virtual assistant experience more personalized. You can choose a voice that you find more pleasant to listen to, or one that feels more relatable to your culture or region. So, revamp your Siri experience today by changing its voice.

Admittedly, Siri's come a long way to become a somewhat reliable voice assistant. Asking it to do things works over half the time now, and it's always fun to try. 
But changing Siri's voice goes beyond giving it a fun, new accent. With a variety of voices to choose from, including accents, genders, and a gender-neutral option, Siri can now sound more like your own voice. As one of many immigrants in this country, for me, that little bit of inclusivity goes a long way in a world of growing divisions.

## How can I change Siri's voice back to the original?


The process to change Siri's voice back to the original is the same: Go to your iPhone's Settings and select Siri & Search; then, choose Siri Voice. Right now, Siri's original voice is called American, Voice 4. 

 
## Who is the voice of Siri?


Voice actress Susan Bennett from Atlanta, Georgia, is the voice of Siri we've come to know and love (or not) in the US. Though Apple hasn't officially confirmed this information, Bennett has said she started working on Siri's voice with Apple in July 2005, several years before Siri's launch in October 2011. 

 
## What celebrities can I change Siri's voice to?


Unfortunately, Siri does not support any alternative voices to the ones that are available in the iPhone's settings at this time. Though it would be cool to have Morgan Freeman, Darth Vader, or Yoda reading your reminders and telling you the weather, Apple hasn't announced any plans to expand Siri with any celebrity voices in a permanent fashion.

 
## How do I get more voices for Siri?


The only available voices for Siri are the ones found in the iPhone's settings under Siri & Search. There's no way to get more voices for Siri through a third party.

 
## Can you customize Hey, Siri?


Though you can change Siri's accent and the sound of its voice, you can't customize Siri's trademark wake phrase, "Hey, Siri." However, you can bypass the wake phrase by turning off the toggle that has your phone constantly listening for, "Hey, Siri," and simply using the side button to wake the voice assistant.

 
## Is Siri bilingual?
