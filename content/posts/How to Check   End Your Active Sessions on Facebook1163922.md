# You won't believe what Facebook is hiding from you! Learn how to END all active sessions in just 2 minutes!

If you're one of the millions of Facebook users worldwide, you probably don't know that Facebook is hiding something from you. And that something is the fact that your Facebook account may be logged in in multiple places, allowing others to access your personal information and sensitive data without your knowledge. The good news is that you can quickly end all active sessions and protect your privacy in just two minutes.

What are active sessions?

Active sessions are instances where your Facebook account is currently logged in, and you might not be aware of them. Active sessions may include any device you've used to access your Facebook account, such as your smartphone, tablet, or computer. Other people who use your device or have access to your Facebook information also may have active sessions on your Facebook account.

Why should you end all active sessions?

It's essential to end all active Facebook sessions as it's a significant threat to our digital privacy. Your personal information, such as emails, messages, financial information, and sensitive data, can be shared with others or accessed by cybercriminals. In severe cases, cybercriminals can even hijack your account or steal your identity by exploiting these active sessions, which is why it's essential to recognize and end all active sessions.

How to end all active sessions in two minutes or less?

Here are the steps to end all active sessions in just two minutes or less.

Step 1: Launch Facebook

Log in to Facebook on a device that you trust and has secure internet access.

Step 2: Access Facebook Account Settings

From the Facebook homepage, click on the arrow icon at the top right corner of the screen. Then click on "Settings" and select "Security and Login."

Step 3: View Active Sessions

Scroll down, and under "Where You're Logged In," you'll find a list of all active sessions. This list includes where you're logged in from, what type of device you're using, and when you last logged in.

Step 4: End Active Sessions

Click "Log Out Of All Sessions." This option will log you out of all Facebook sessions, including any active sessions that you might not have realized existed.

Step 5: Confirm Logout

A dialogue box will appear asking if you want to log out of all sessions. Click on the "Log Out" button to confirm.

In conclusion, ending all active sessions will enable you to secure your Facebook account against cybercriminals and protect your privacy. So, make sure to take this necessary security measure to keep your Facebook account safe. Plus, the process is straightforward and super-quick, taking not more than two minutes to complete.
