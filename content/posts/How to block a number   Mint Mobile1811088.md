We’ve all been there. Whether you’re getting calls from a telemarketer in Florida, pestered by a Hinge date that won’t take a hint, or want to get rid of spam calls for good, knowing how to block a number is a useful skill. Let’s get into it.

## What happens when you block a number on iPhone


You might be hesitant to block someone’s number because you don’t want them to know you’re doing so. Don’t worry, they won’t receive any sort of notification – even if they try to reach you afterwards. Texts that are sent or received won’t be delivered. They will, however, still be able to leave a voicemail, but you won’t get a notification if they do. Phew.

 
## How to block text messages on iPhone

## How to block different types of calls 


Knowing how to block certain calls can depend on where the call is coming from. Here’s how to block the usual suspects:

 
### How to block spam calls


If you keep getting spammed by the same telemarketers, you’ll be glad to know you can easily block their number. Complete the same steps from above, depending on the brand of your device.

 
### How to block restricted calls


If you’re tired of seeing “Unknown Caller” ID, you can do one of two things:

 
#### Send all restricted calls to voicemail
 
Go to Settings > PhoneTap “Silence Unknown Callers” and toggle “On”
 
#### Create a contact for restricted numbers and block it
 
Open the Phone AppTap ContactsPress the + sign to add a new contact and enter 000-000-0000Scroll down and select “Block This Caller”
 
## How to unblock a number


If you have a change of heart, unblocking a number is (for better or worse) as easy as blocking one.

 
## How to unblock a number on Android
 
Open the Phone appTap the More icon (this looks like three vertical dots)Hit Settings > Blocked NumbersTap X next to the number you’d like to unblock
 
## How to unblock a number on iPhone
 
Open your Phone app Tap Recents Hit the ‘Info’ button next to the number you’d like to unblockScroll down and tap ‘Unblock this Caller’ *


*Warning: you might want to think twice before unblocking an ex. You know the one.

 
## How to see blocked numbers on iPhone


To see a list of numbers that are blocked on your phone:

 
Open Settings app Tap on Phone app Hit Blocked Contacts to see what numbers are blocked
 
## How to block your number when calling


If you want to go incognito and hide your number while calling someone, just type in *67 before entering their phone number. This is a perfect way to ensure someone can’t save your number when you call them. You will have to type in *67 each time you call to remain anonymous, though. 
Happy prank-calling, friends.

 
## How to know if someone blocked your number


Unfortunately, there’s no surefire way to know if someone blocked your number. There are a couple indicators that might suggest your number has been blocked, though.

 
Your calls are being directly sent to voicemailYou send a text and do not see a “Delivered” confirmation. This is only really helpful if both parties have iPhones. Texts sent to Android users will go through normally; they just won’t be delivered. 


If these things happen when you try to reach a number, it doesn’t always mean you’re blocked. They could have their cellular data or phone turned off. They also could be out of cell signal range. 
If you find out you are blocked, don’t sweat it. You’re better off without ‘em. If you really want to block all negativity from your phone, it might be time to ditch big wireless. (Psst… you can even BYOP).
