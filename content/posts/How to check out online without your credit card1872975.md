Innovative Hack: Purchase Online WITHOUT Ever Using Your Credit Card Again!

Online shopping has revolutionized the way we shop for goods and services. With just a few clicks, we can purchase anything we want, anytime we want, and have it delivered to our doorstep. Despite its convenience, there is always a lurking risk of fraud and identity theft, especially when we use credit cards to make online purchases. But what if we told you that there’s a way to shop online without ever using your credit card again? Yes, it’s possible, and here’s how:

The first thing you need to do is to set up a PayPal account. PayPal is a digital wallet that allows you to make and receive payments without disclosing your credit card information. Once you have signed up for a PayPal account, you can link it to your bank account or debit card to make purchases.

Here’s the best part- PayPal offers a feature called “Guest Checkout,” which allows you to make purchases without logging in to your PayPal account or sharing your credit card details. When you see the PayPal option at the checkout page, click on it, and select “Guest Checkout.” Enter your debit card details or bank account information, and voila, your purchase is complete!

But wait, there’s even more innovation in the works. Enter ‘Buy Now Pay Later’ programs. These programs, such as Afterpay and Klarna, let you split the cost of your purchase into smaller, interest-free installments. You don’t have to pay everything upfront, and you don’t need a credit card to enroll in these programs. Instead, you link your bank account, and they will deduct the installments from your account on a designated schedule.

By using these programs, you can avoid paying high-interest rates on credit card debt, and enjoy the flexibility of paying over time. Furthermore, these programs have become increasingly popular with online retailers, and you can avail of them for most online purchases.

In conclusion, shopping online has never been more convenient, but it also comes with risks. By adopting new payment options such as PayPal Guest Checkout and Buy Now Pay Later programs, you can shop online with peace of mind, knowing that your financial information is safe and secure. So go ahead and hit that buy button without worrying about exposing your credit card information again!

The danger of inputting your credit card information on a shopping site is hackers to that site, or to your computer, could see that information and use it themselves — or sell your information to others who will use it. The more you can protect your credit card number the better, so try using these methods of paying without directly using your bank account or credit card.
These methods can also help you budget if that’s something you want to easily keep track of. Read on to see our tips on how to check out online without using your credit card.

 
## Indirectly use your card or bank account


The easiest way to buy things online without using your credit card is to join a service that lets you use your card or bank account indirectly in a secure way. One of the most popular services like this is Privacy, which generates virtual credit cards for you to use on purchases wherever you shop online.

When you sign up for Privacy, you input your bank account or credit card information once, on a secure webpage. This keeps it in a safe place on the site, where it can’t be accessed by outsiders (at least not easily).
 
 
From there, the site helps you create virtual credit cards that you can use for any and all of your online purchases. You can pause these virtual cards at any time, making fraudulent purchases with them almost impossible.
Simply unpause them when you want to use them again. Or, you can close a card entirely if you decide never to use it again.
If you’re really worried about someone accessing your virtual card, you can put a spending limit on it. This can help if you want to pay regular subscription fees securely or set a firm budget on your online shopping.
Privacy is a great way to keep track of your online shopping while you avoid being a casualty of a retailer data breach, which leaves credit card and debit card information accessible to wily and opportunistic hackers and identity thieves. And the best part? It’s totally free!
Privacy makes its money by charging merchants and websites a small fee, much like regular credit cards do. So you won’t pay a cent to have secure, virtual credit cards through Privacy. Tap or click here to sign up for an account and start shopping more safely right here.

 
## Keep those credit cards hidden


The other major service you can sign up for that allows you to input your information once and then shop securely without typing your credit card number again is PayPal. A secure way to send money to people in your life, PayPal also lets you send money to merchants.

Signing up for PayPal is free. You input a credit card, or your bank account information and then you’re good to start making purchases. Simply click the PayPal option when you’re checking out while online shopping, which again is an option most major retailers have.
You’ll be prompted to log in to your PayPal account and confirm the purchase. With the confirmation, you’ll get a special PayPal receipt to your email, on top of whatever receipt the actual site gives you.
In giving you secure and faster ways to pay for things online, and ways to send money to friends and family with ease, PayPal is a great option — the only downside is, not every place you shop online will have PayPal as an option at checkout.
If you haven’t signed up for a PayPal account yet but want to, tap or click here.

 
## Safest online shopping solution you’ve never thought of


For a less digital way of securely checking out without your credit card, try using gift cards when you shop online. These cards can be purchased for a particular retailer, or you can get general gift cards, like ones from Visa and American Express, to make your online purchases.
With set amounts on the cards, you can once again keep your online spending down by using these just as much as you can keep your purchases secure. After all, if these numbers get hacked, you’ll only lose the amount left on the card — perhaps not an insignificant amount of money, but far less than if you input your credit or debit card information on a site.
The only downside to this option is you may need to keep a few cards on hand at any given time, and they can expire if you don’t utilize them. Privacy and PayPal might be more convenient and easier to access on a daily basis but to keep yourself truly safe, use gift cards in your checkout instead of your credit card.
