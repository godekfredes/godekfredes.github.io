Title: Unlocking the Secret to Perfect Photo Backups on Android - Change Your Google Photos Quality in One Easy Step!

Are you tired of running out of storage space on your Android device because of all the photos and videos you’ve taken? Are you worried about losing precious memories due to accidental deletion, device malfunction, or theft?

Well, worry no more as we reveal the secret to perfect photo backups on Android - changing your Google Photos quality in one easy step!

Google Photos is a free and convenient cloud storage service that automatically backs up your photos and videos to your Google account. By default, Google Photos uploads your media in “High quality” mode, which compresses the file size and lowers the resolution to save storage space.

However, if you’re a photography enthusiast or professional who wants to preserve the original quality of your images and videos, you can opt to upload them in “Original quality” mode. But beware, this option requires more storage space and may incur additional storage fees if you exceed the free 15GB allocation.

To change your Google Photos quality mode, simply follow these steps:

1. Open your Google Photos app on your Android device.
2. Tap on your profile picture in the top right corner and select “Settings.”
3. Scroll down and find the “Back up & sync” option.
4. Tap on “Upload size” and choose between “High quality” and “Original quality.”
5. If you select “Original quality,” you’ll be prompted to confirm the storage usage and any potential fees.

Once you’ve changed your Google Photos quality mode, your new uploads will reflect your chosen setting. However, your existing photos and videos will remain in their previous quality mode unless you manually back them up again.

With this one easy step, you can unlock the secret to perfect photo backups on Android, preserving your precious memories for years to come. So go ahead, give it a try and let Google Photos do the heavy lifting for you!
