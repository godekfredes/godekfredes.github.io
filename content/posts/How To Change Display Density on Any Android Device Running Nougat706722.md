Title: You've Been Using Your Android Wrong This Whole Time: The Surprising Trick to Optimize Your Display Density!

Introduction:

Android is one of the most popular mobile operating systems, and it is used by millions of people around the world. The Android operating system offers a lot of customization options, and users can tweak various settings to make their device work the way they want. One of these settings is the display density, which is often overlooked by users. In this article, we will show you how to optimize your display density to get the most out of your Android device.

Body:

What is display density, and why is it important?

The display density is the number of pixels per inch (PPI) on your device's screen. The higher the display density, the crisper and sharper the images will appear on your screen. Android devices come with different display densities, and users can change the density using a few simple steps. Changing the display density can make a big difference in the way your device works, especially if you have a device with a large screen.

How to change the display density on your Android device?

To change the display density on your Android device, you need to enable the developer options. Here's how to do it:

1. Go to your device's settings and scroll down to the About Phone section.
2. Tap on the Build Number option several times until you see a message that says you are now a developer.
3. Go back to the settings menu and look for the Developer options section.
4. Once you find the Developer options, tap on it and look for the option that says Display size.
5. Tap on Display size, and you will see a slider that you can use to adjust the display density of your device.

What is the optimal display density for my Android device?

The optimal display density for your Android device depends on several factors such as the size of your device's screen and your personal preference. If you have a large-screen device and want to fit more content on your screen, you can increase the display density to make everything appear smaller. On the other hand, if you have a small-screen device and want everything to be more readable, you can decrease the display density to make everything appear bigger.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, changing the display density on your Android device can make a big difference in the way your device works. By optimizing your display density, you can get more out of your Android device and make it work the way you want. With these simple steps, you can adjust the display density on your Android device and start experiencing the benefits of a sharper and crisper display. So, don't wait any longer, and start optimizing your display density today!

Unlike Marshmallow, Google has introduced plenty of new features with Android 7.0 Nougat. While the key highlights of the OS have to be the redesigned notification shade, Direct Reply, and multi-window multitasking, the latest and sweetest version of Android also comes with many little useful additions and enhancements.
One such feature that Google has introduced in Nougat is the ability to change Display Density easily. While it was possible to change display density on previous versions of Android as well, it required the use of adb and on some devices, root access.
In case you are unaware of what Display Density is, it allows you to regulate the amount of information being displayed on the screen. Changing the Display Density leads to the size of actual UI elements increasing/decreasing, unlike say while changing Font size which only controls the size of the font and only some associated UI elements.
Changing the Display Density might not seem like a feature that many people think they will use, but once you start using it and find that perfect density for your device, there is no going back.
So, here’s how you can change the Display Density of your Android device running Nougat, including the Google Pixel, LG V20, LG G5, and others.
Step 1: Head over to Settings -> Display -> Display Size.
Step 2: Depending on your preference, drag the slider at the bottom to the left or right. Dragging it to the left will make everything smaller on the screen while dragging it to the right will do the opposite.
Step 3: Once you have found the perfect density for your phone’s display, simply exit the Settings menu for your changes to be saved.
Do note that changing the display density only affects apps and Android OS itself, with games remaining unaffected since they use their own scaling options.
On some Samsung devices running Nougat, the display density option will be shown as Display Scaling under Display. The feature is also available on some of Samsung’s devices running Marshmallow like the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge.
