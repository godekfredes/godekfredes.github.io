# Stop App Overload! Learn How To Customize Android Nougat Notifications To Show Only Your Favourite Apps!

In today's world, smartphones have become an integral part of our lives. We use them to stay connected with our loved ones, for work, entertainment, and much more. With so many apps on our smartphones, notifications can become overwhelming and distractive. Thankfully, the Android Nougat operating system has a way to customize the notifications that you receive.

In this article, we'll show you how to customize Android Nougat notifications to display only your favorite apps.

## Step 1: Access The Notification Settings

To customize your notifications, you need to access the notification settings on your Android Nougat device. The process to access the settings may vary depending on your device manufacturer. However, you can generally access the notification settings by swiping down from the top of your screen and tapping on the gear icon located at the top right corner.

## Step 2: Select The “Apps & Notifications” Option

After accessing the settings, scroll down to the “Apps & notifications” section and tap on it. Next, select the “Notifications” option.

## Step 3: Customize App Notifications

After selecting the “Notifications” option, you will see a list of apps that have notification access on your device. Touch the specific app that you want to customize, and you will see different notification settings for that app.

Here, you can choose to block all notifications from the app, enable notification dots or badges, and decide to let the notification sound or vibrate your phone. Besides that, you can choose to prioritize the app's notifications by setting it to “urgent” or “high” priority.

If you want to prevent an app from appearing in the notification bar, you can turn off the toggle switch for the “Show notifications” option. This will stop the app from displaying notifications on your device.

Furthermore, under “Categories” or “Advanced”, you can access even more settings like the ability to silence notifications from a specific channel within an app, restrict notifications, and more.

## Step 4: Folder-Based Notifications

With Android Nougat, you can also organize your notifications by folder. This feature allows users to create folders that group notifications based on a specific category or theme. To create a notification folder, long-press on an app's notification in the notification shade and drag it over to another app's notification. By doing this, you will create a folder, and you can then customize the notifications in that folder from the settings menu.

## Conclusion

With the Android Nougat operating system, you can customize your app notifications to display only the notifications that matter to you. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can easily customize your notifications, prevent app overload and stay focused on what's important to you.
