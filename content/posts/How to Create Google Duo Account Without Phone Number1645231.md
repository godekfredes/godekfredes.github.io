# Unlock the Secret to Making Google Duo Account - No Phone Number Required! Shocking Tips Inside!

Are you tired of being asked for your phone number every time you try to create a Google Duo account? Well, we have some good news for you! With these shocking tips, you can create a Google Duo account without a phone number. 

Google Duo is a video calling app that has gained immense popularity in recent years. It is loved by millions of users because of its simplicity and easy-to-use features. However, creating an account often requires an active phone number. This can be a major turn off for many users who do not wish to share their numbers with third-party apps.

But worry not; we have got you covered. Here are some simple yet effective tips that can help you create a Google Duo account without a phone number. 

## Tip #1: Using a Landline Number

Did you know that you can use a landline number instead of a mobile number to create a Google Duo account? Although this may seem like an outdated option, it can be a great alternative for those who do not have a mobile number or do not want to share it.

To create an account using a landline number, follow the same steps that you would for a mobile number. Enter the landline number in the appropriate field and wait for the verification code to be sent to you via voice call or message.

## Tip #2: Using a Google Voice Number

Google Voice is a service provided by Google that allows you to make and receive phone calls using a Google Voice number. This number is completely separate from your actual phone number and can be used to make calls and send messages to anyone, anywhere.

To create a Google Duo account using a Google Voice number, follow these steps:

1. Install the Google Voice app on your mobile phone.
2. Open the app and sign in with your Google account.
3. Follow the prompts to set up your Google Voice number.
4. Use this number to create a Google Duo account.

## Tip #3: Using a Temporary Phone Number

If you want to keep your personal phone number private, you can use a temporary phone number to create a Google Duo account. There are several websites that offer temporary phone numbers for free or for a small fee. You can use these numbers to receive verification codes and create your account.

However, be cautious when using temporary phone numbers as they may not always be reliable or secure. Use them at your own risk.

In conclusion, creating a Google Duo account without a phone number is possible with these simple tricks. Whether you prefer a landline number, a Google Voice number, or a temporary phone number, there are several options available. So, go ahead and try them out today!
