One of my favorite features of Samsung’s Experience UI is the ability to customize the system font type. While most OEMs do allow users to change the system font size on their devices, Samsung is the only one that allows users to change the font type as well. This stands true for its latest flagship handset: the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+.

Similar to previous flagship Galaxy devices, you can easily change system font and size on the Galaxy S9. While changing the system font might not seem like a good deal, it does help in refreshing the look and feel of the UI. It is a change that you will not realize until you have experienced it. Sold? Now wondering how to change system fonts in your Galaxy S9? Follow the steps below.

 
### How to Change System Fonts in Samsung Galaxy S9


Step 1: Head over to Settings -> Display -> Screen zoom and font. Here, you will find all the options related to system fonts including its size and display zoom.

Step 2: To change the system font, simply select any of the pre-installed fonts from the ‘Font Style’ option located at the very bottom and tap the ‘Apply’ button located at the top-right corner.
Do note that you can only install additional fonts on your Galaxy S9 from the Galaxy Store. Downloading third-party fonts from the Play Store
To change system font size, simply drag the slider under Font size to left or right depending on your preference.
The problem with increasing the font size is that it reduces the amount of content being displayed on the screen. However, reducing the font size will not lead to more content being displayed on the screen. For that, you will need to change the display density which Google has made it very easy with Nougat.
Samsung has its own implementation of this feature called Screen Zoom. With Screen Zoom, you can adjust the amount of content being displayed on the screen. This is different from changing the font size as here the UI will also scale depending on whether you increase or decrease the DPI. So, the lower the DPI/screen zoom you select, the more content will be displayed on the screen and vice versa.
You can find the Screen Zoom related options under Settings -> Display on your Galaxy S9.
