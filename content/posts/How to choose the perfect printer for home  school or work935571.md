Title: Stop Wasting Money on Unreliable Printers! Learn the Secret to Choosing the Perfect Printer for Your Home, School, or Work Needs Today!

Introduction:

Printers are an essential device that almost every household or office needs. But the problem is, with the ever-growing number of options and features in the market, choosing the right printer can be quite a daunting task. Not only do we fall prey to the various advertisements, but we also end up buying cheap and unreliable printers that can cost us a lot more in the long run. To overcome this problem, knowing the secret to choosing the perfect printer for your needs is crucial. In this article, we will guide you through the process and help you choose the best printer that is reliable, affordable, and functional.

Section 1: Understanding Your Needs

The first step to choosing the perfect printer is to understand your needs. Determine whether the printer will be used for personal or professional needs. If it's for personal use, then a standard printer that can print, copy, and scan would be perfect for you. However, if it's for professional use, then you might want to consider more advanced features like printing speed, connectivity options, and compatibility.

Section 2: Printer Type

The next crucial factor to consider is the type of printer you want to buy. The most popular types include inkjet, laser, and all-in-one printers. Inkjet printers are best suited for personal use as they are affordable and can print high-quality photos. Laser printers, on the other hand, are best suited for businesses or individuals who need to print large volumes of documents. All-in-one printers are versatile and can handle a variety of tasks, including printing, scanning, copying, and faxing.

Section 3: Connectivity Options

Connectivity is another critical factor to consider. With the advancement of technology, printers can now be connected to a Wi-Fi network, enabling wireless printing. This feature is particularly helpful for individuals who use multiple devices, as they can print directly from their smartphone, tablet, or laptop. Additionally, some printers also have the option to connect via Bluetooth or USB ports.

Section 4: Cost

Finally, the cost is an important factor to consider. While it's tempting to go for the cheapest option, remember that cheap printers often require frequent ink or toner replacements, thereby increasing the overall cost in the long run. Therefore, it's always better to invest in a reliable printer that might cost more upfront but will save you money in the long run.

Conclusion:

Choosing the perfect printer doesn't have to be a daunting task. By understanding your needs, determining the printer type, considering connectivity options, and keeping the cost in mind, you can find a reliable and affordable printer that will serve your needs for years to come. Don't waste any more money on unreliable printers - use this guide to buy the perfect printer for your home, school, or work needs today!

Not only does technology advance quickly, but printers don’t need to be replaced that often, which can make it difficult when it comes time to purchase a new one. That’s what happened to a Komando reader recently, who reached out to us with questions about choosing a new printer. 
If you’re in the market for a printer, we’re here to help you out. There are tons of great options below from our sponsor, Epson. Whether you need a printer that can handle your small business or home office’s needs or you need one for your child’s school work. Epson has you covered.

 
### For a small business or home office where you print a lot


So many of us are working from home right now due to the pandemic. What a lot of us didn’t anticipate, though, is that we’ll need more than just a laptop and an internet connection to make that situation work well. A printer is an essential part of that productivity equation, and a low-end home printer isn’t likely to cut it. 
You need a workhorse of a printer for your home and small business, and that’s precisely what the EcoTank Pro ET-5800 All-in-One Cartridge-Free Supertank Printer is. This one can handle some serious printing jobs. You’ll get print shop quality at a fast speed, and it holds 500 pages — meaning you won’t have to stop and refill paper to get the job done.
It also has super-sized ink tanks that can be refilled with Epson’s low-cost ink replacement bottles. No more expensive cartridges to purchase every few months! You’ll also get a 4.3-inch color touchscreen and hands-free, voice-activated printing, along with scanning, faxing and copying capabilities. In other words, you won’t have to compromise on any feature with this option.
Another solid option is the EcoTank ET-15000 All-in-One Cartridge-Free Supertank Printer. You’ll get the same printer/scanner/fax/copier combo as you would with the ET-5800 and the same low-cost cartridge-free ink, too. The main difference is the ET-15000 can handle paper up to 13-inches x 9-inches thanks to the rear-feed specialty paper tray. 
If you need paper options outside of the standard size, the ET-15000 is a solid choice. You’ll also get a 250-sheet front tray paper capacity, a 2.7-inch color touchscreen and hands-free, voice-activated printing.

 
### Kids in school


Many parents have taken on the role of educator in the last several months. The pandemic has caused schools across the nation to go partially or fully online, which means most schoolwork is now done at home. Your old printer may not be able to handle that increased workload. But this EcoTank ET-4760 All-in-One Cartridge-Free Supertank Printer can.
This printer is the perfect way to handle schoolwork. It’s powered by PrecisionCore and has auto 2-sided printing, a 30-sheet Auto Document Feeder, and the Supertank ink tanks that cut down on ink costs significantly. Need to scan and send your child’s assignments back? This printer also offers fax, scanning, and copying capabilities, too. 
Another upside? It has a 2.4-inch color touchscreen, voice-activated printing, and wired and wireless connectivity. This means even your younger kids can take charge of their schoolwork without much help. Perfect!

 
### On a budget


Looking for a budget-friendly printer? There are tons of options out there for low-cost printers, but not all of them offer what the EcoTank ET-2720 All-in-One Supertank Printer does. You can print, copy, and scan with this model and it won’t break the bank. What’s awesome about this option is you don’t have to compromise on the features for a lower price. 
The ET-2720 can handle all of your 8.5-inch x 11-inch print jobs in color or black and white and you can easily print borderless 4-inch x 6-inch photos with it, too. It has a 100-sheet paper capacity and the same Supertank ink tanks that higher-end Epson printers have. You’ll save money both on your printer purchase and ink refills, which are significantly cheaper than cartridges other printers use.
As a bonus, you can use Alexa voice commands with this printer. You can also print directly from tablets and smartphones with its Wi-Fi direct capabilities. Not bad for a printer with a price tag of less than $200. 

 
### Need all the bells and whistles (fax, scanner, voice printing, wide format)


You want a printer that can handle anything you throw at it, like specialty paper, wide-format prints and scans, and anything else you can dream up? The EcoTank Pro ET-16650 Wide-format All-in-One Supertank Printer is the right choice for you. 
This model comes with every feature you could want and we do mean every. It’s a great option for people who need to print documents with brilliant, crisp colors or those who regularly need to print on specialty paper. 
Voice printing? Check. Fax? Check. Scanner? Check. Wide-format capabilities? Check. The EcoTank Pro ET-16650 does it all. It can handle large print jobs thanks to the 500-sheet paper capacity, and it has two front trays plus a rear feed for specialty paper. 
This printer can handle jobs with paper up to 13-inch x 19-inch, copy and scan jobs with paper up to 11-inch x 17-inch, and has those same Supertanks that cut down on ink costs by about 80% on average. 
You’ll also get the capability for auto 2-sided print, copy, scan, and fax as well as a 4.3-inch color touchscreen. It offers hands-free, voice-activated printing and easy wireless printing from your iPad, iPhone, Android tablet and smartphone. Print anything from any device? Sounds like a win.
