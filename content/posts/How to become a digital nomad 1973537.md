If you’ve been curious about this lifestyle or are looking to make the switch, this guide is for you.

First things first, what is a digital nomad? A digital nomad is someone who uses technology to work remotely from anywhere in the world. They may work from their laptops, smartphones, or tablets, and can work from anywhere with a strong internet connection. This lifestyle allows for a freedom of location and the ability to travel while still earning an income.

But what are some of the key components to living the digital nomad lifestyle successfully? Let’s break it down:

1. Skillset - To be a digital nomad, you need to possess skills that are in demand in order to make a living. This can include anything from content creation to coding, social media management, web design, and more. You need to be able to offer value to people online who will be willing to pay for your services.

2. Mindset - Living the digital nomad lifestyle requires a certain mindset. You need to be able to adapt to different environments, manage your time and workload, and deal with the challenges that come with traveling and working. You need to be self-motivated and disciplined in order to balance work with exploration and adventure.

3. Technology - Technology is your lifeline as a digital nomad. You need to have reliable tools and software to help you work efficiently, communicate with clients, and keep your data secure. A good laptop, smartphone, and high-speed internet connection are essential.

4. Travel - Of course, travel is a key ingredient of the digital nomad lifestyle. But, it’s important to plan your travels strategically. You need to factor in things like visa requirements, cost of living, time zones, and reliable internet access before choosing your next destination. It’s also important to have a travel budget and stick to it to ensure you don’t run out of money on the road.

Now that you know the basics, how do you actually become a digital nomad? Here are some steps to get started:

1. Identify your skills and niche. What are you good at? What services can you offer remotely? Be specific in your niche to help set yourself apart from other digital nomads.

2. Build a portfolio or website showcasing your work. This is how you’ll attract clients and showcase your work to potential employers.

Becoming a digital nomad means taking the right steps in research, education/training, and self-management steps. 
Read the steps below for a detailed roadmap on how to become a digital nomad and what issues you need to consider at each point in your journey.

 
### 1. Research remote careers.


Start by researching digital nomad careers and see which appeal to you. Many digital nomads work as web developers or in similar computer science-related jobs. Digital nomads commonly pursue majors including: 

 
Computer scienceGraphic designInformation technology Creative writing


The digital nomad lifestyle can accommodate a variety of work styles, including full-time employment, freelancing, and owning a small business.
Not all remote jobs allow you to work as a digital nomad. You need a set work location if you work in management, financial services, or any industry involving in-person meetings with clients or coworkers.

 
### 2. Get the appropriate training.


You need the right training to secure a digital nomad career. Most digital nomads hold at least a bachelor's. Computer science degrees and related majors are popular picks. 
Many schools offer online programs that allow you to earn your degree at your convenience. You can even travel while earning your online degree, so long as you set appropriate boundaries for maintaining work/leisure balance.
Additionally, many coding bootcamps can now be completed remotely in an online format in three to six months.

 
### 3. Apply for remote jobs.


You can make applying for a remote job easier by knowing where to look. Popular remote job boards include:

If you look elsewhere, focus your efforts on fully remote or remote-first companies such as Shopify, Bandcamp, or Hopin. Certain job titles, such as software engineer, often cater to remote workers. 
When applying for a job, create a bulleted list of relevant questions to ask during your interview.

 
In what time zone is the employer based?Will you ever be expected to work in person during the year or attend events?What software platforms, if any, does the workplace use?
 
### 4. Choose a work location. 


Your destination choice also matters. It is illegal to work remotely on a tourist visa. Recently, some countries have developed "digital nomad" visas for remote workers, including:

 
SpainCosta RicaBarbadosGermany


Or, you can work remotely while traveling the U.S. You get to experience a different culture or move to a lower COL area without changing jobs. 
Employers may limit the states and countries where their employees may work for tax or other reasons. Check with your employer before you buy a ticket.
Also, be aware of technical concerns such as time zone differences and availability of Wi-Fi. Consider purchasing equipment such as a Wi-Fi booster to avoid emergencies. You may also need a local cell phone and data plan.
Language barriers can create problems when traveling abroad, but translation guides and free language learning apps help.

 
### 5. Prepare for your departure.


Before you embark on your new life as a digital nomad, you need to prepare. You can deal with belongings you can't bring by:

 
Renting a storage unitDonating belongings you don't needLeaving your belongings or car with family or friends


Next, you need to find a place to live. Homestays, hostels, and renting with roommates work well on a tight budget. You can always change your living situation later.
After you arrive, don't just hole up with your work laptop. Look out for digital nomad events and local tours. Try socializing in local clubs and cafes to meet new people and make friends.
