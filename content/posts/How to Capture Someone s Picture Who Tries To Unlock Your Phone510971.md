# Unmasked: Secretly Snap a Photo of Anyone Sneaking a Peek at Your Phone!

Have you ever caught someone trying to look at your phone screen from over your shoulder? It’s an invasion of privacy that can be incredibly frustrating, especially if you’re trying to read something confidential or sensitive. Fortunately, there’s a new app called Unmasked that can help you catch these snoops in the act!

Unmasked is an app that uses your phone’s front-facing camera to take a photo of anyone who tries to look at your screen without your permission. Here’s how it works:

1. Download and install the app from the App Store or Google Play.

2. Open the app and grant it permission to access your camera.

3. Choose whether you want Unmasked to take a photo whenever someone looks at your screen or only when they’re looking at it for a certain amount of time (e.g. more than 5 seconds).

4. Adjust the sensitivity of the app to ensure it only triggers when someone is actually looking at your screen, not just glancing in your direction.

5. Lock your phone and place it face-down as you normally would.

From there, Unmasked will run in the background of your phone and automatically take a photo whenever someone tries to peek at your screen. The photo will be stored in the app’s gallery, so you can review it later and figure out who was trying to snoop.

Of course, Unmasked isn’t foolproof. If someone is standing directly behind you or crouching down low, they might be able to avoid detection by the app’s camera. But for the most part, it’s a great way to catch people in the act and deter them from trying to snoop in the future.

Some people might argue that using an app like Unmasked is a bit paranoid or excessive. After all, isn’t it natural for people to be curious about what you’re doing on your phone? While that might be true to some extent, it’s also important to remember that our phones contain a lot of sensitive information that we might not want others to see. Whether it’s private messages, confidential work documents, or personal photos, we all have a right to protect our digital privacy.

If you’re someone who values your privacy and wants to deter people from trying to snoop on your phone, Unmasked is definitely worth a try. Give it a download and start using it today!
