Stocking up non-perishable food items can come in handy in case of extended power outages or other emergency situations. These emergency foods can include canned fruits and vegetables, protein bars or granola bars, and other meal replacement items.

4. First Aid Kit 

A  well-equipped first aid kit can help tackle any medical emergencies that might arise during winter. It should contain basic medical supplies like adhesive bandages, antiseptic wipes, and over-the-counter pain relievers.

5. Water 

Water is crucial for survival in any emergency situation, and during winter, dehydration can occur due to the low humidity levels. Stock up on ample amounts of water and enough to sustain you for at least one week.

6. Warm Clothes 

During power outages, staying warm is necessary to prevent hypothermia. Ensure to pack thick warm layers to keep yourself and your family warm during the winter weather.

Temperatures will plummet so low in some areas that exposed skin could suffer from frostbite in five minutes.

And this is just the beginning, with temperatures in affected areas dropping 30 to 50 degrees below normal in the coming days.
Winter is coming. 
Whether you're someone who hunkers down when the weather gets bad, or you have to be out and about, technology can make a difference. And while most of the time that difference is reducing a problem into an inconvenience, sometimes -- and I don't want to sound overly dramatic saying this -- it can be the difference between life and death.
Here's my plan of action. And while it changes as tech moves forward and I learn more, I find this covers most of the bases.
Note that you might need to cater for different types of emergencies. Maybe the power goes out for days or even weeks, or maybe flooding is a risk.

I will recommend some products that I have personally tested and use that I have found to be reliable (this is not the time to find out that something is unreliable!).

Add stress and fear into the mix, and you have the potential for a lot of chaos.
Not sure how your portable battery pack, generator, or new weather app works? The time to be figuring this out is now, not when you are hip-deep in snow and the lights are out.

Oh, and now is a good time to download and print out any manuals you might need.
Also, the more you practice and use your gear, the more likely you are to remember you have it. I've known people forget that they have some useful bit of kit when an emergency hits. 
It's not a failing, it's human nature.
This is especially important if you live somewhere where the power is likely to go out.
Also, remember to charge up any portable battery packs and rechargeable batteries that you might have (you might not need them, but they may help a neighbor out of a bind).
For things I keep at home, I charge these up to 100%, and I have a power station and a couple of power banks that stay on charge all the time for such emergencies.

For things that I throw into the car and forget about for six months or a year, I charge these up to about 80%, as this is better for longer-term storage.

Go on. No one will judge you!
Also: How to get water out of your phone
If you don't have a weatherproof case, then a Ziploc bag is better than nothing. And if you have one of those little bags of silica gel that comes with all sorts of things you buy, throw one or two of those into the bag with your device, as it'll help absorb any water that makes its way into the bag.
An off-site or cloud backup is preferable (even if "off-site" means keeping a drive at a friend or family member's house).
If all you have is an external hard drive or USB key, then that will have to do -- pop it into a waterproof bag to give it a fighting chance! Alternatively, you can invest in a waterproof and fireproof storage drive.

My solution is to back up to the cloud using Backblaze, and also have local backups in a waterproof and fireproof RAID external unit for easy access.
