Introduction:

In the age of digital technology, hackers have become increasingly sophisticated in their methods of infiltrating personal and corporate computer networks. One of the most effective ways to prevent these attacks is by using antivirus software. Windows Defender Antivirus is one such program that is available for Windows users. On Komando, you can learn how to use this antivirus software to block dangerous programs and protect your computer from malware.

Tips on How to Block Dangerous Programs with Windows Defender Antivirus:

Windows Defender Antivirus is a built-in program in Windows 10 that helps protect your computer from malware. It's already installed on your computer, so you don't need to do anything to install it. However, there are several things that you need to keep in mind to block dangerous programs and optimize the program's performance.

First, ensure that Windows Defender Antivirus is up-to-date. This will ensure that it is protected from the latest threats. Secondly, enable periodic scanning to detect and remove malware. You can also perform a quick scan anytime you suspect that your computer may be infected with malware.

Thirdly, enable real-time protection to receive warnings and alerts about suspicious behavior. This will allow you to take action before the malware can execute any malicious actions on your computer. Finally, configure the firewall settings to prevent unauthorized access to your computer.

Importance of Using Antivirus Software in Blocking Malware Attacks:

Using antivirus software is essential in preventing malware attacks. Malware is malicious software that can take over your computer, steal personal information, and damage or delete files. It's estimated that cybercrime will cost the world over $10 trillion annually by 2025.

Antivirus software can help protect your personal and corporate data from phishing scams, ransomware attacks, and other malicious hacks. It can also provide protection against spam, spyware, and adware.

How Windows Defender Antivirus Can Protect Your Personal Data:

Windows Defender Antivirus can protect your personal data by scanning your computer for malware, spyware, and adware. It can also help you identify and remove potentially unwanted programs (PUPs). You can configure the program to scan your computer on a regular basis, or you can perform scans manually.

Real-time protection is another essential feature that can protect your computer from malware attacks. The program can also scan email attachments, USB drives, and other removable storage devices to prevent malware from getting onto your computer.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, Windows Defender Antivirus is an essential tool for protecting your computer from malware attacks. You can learn more about the program's features and how to optimize its performance by visiting Komando. By following the tips on using Windows Defender Antivirus, you can ensure that your personal and corporate data is protected from phishing scams, ransomware attacks, and other malicious hacks.

But of course, with all the malware, viruses, and phishing threats lurking in every corner, if you don’t take basic security precautions, your computer’s functionality will ultimately not last. All it takes is one installation of a malicious application to ruin your PC and worse, have all your information stolen.
If you’re running Windows 8 or 10, you may have noticed that your system already has built-in antivirus and malware protection software called Windows Defender. It’s actually a decent program for guarding your PC against virus and malware threats.
Note: Windows Defender is not available for Windows 7 machines. If you’re looking to protect an older Windows 7 machine, you can download the comparable Microsoft Security Essentials.

 
### Get yourself some protection


For real-time protection against potential threats, you should enable Windows Defender’s Potentially Unwanted Application (PUA) protection to automatically block downloadable programs that may cause harm or compromise your computer with further malicious programs.
Although these flagged items may not be immediate threats themselves, they could open your computer up to all sorts of problematic items like browser hijackers, adware, spyware and other add-ons that can affect performance.

 
### How to enable Windows Defender PUA protection


Here’s how to turn it on the Windows Defender Potentially Unwanted Application (PUA) protection feature on your Windows 8 or 10 computer:
1. On your Search bar, search for Windows Powershell
2. Right-click on the best match then select Run as Administrator

3. Type (or copy and paste) this command on the Windows PowerShell Window:
Set-MpPreference -PUAProtection 1
4. Hit Enter

That’s it! Your Windows Defender Potentially Unwanted Application (PUA)  protection feature is now on.

 
### How to check if it’s enabled


Here’s how to check if your system’s Windows Defender Potentially Unwanted Application (PUA) protection feature is working.
1. Visit this Microsoft Windows Defender Potentially Unwanted Applications page
2. Under the Scenario section, click the provided link

3. That link will open an Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organization (AMTSO) webpage
4. On that page, click the “Download the Potentially Unwanted Application ‘test’ file…” link

5. If your system’s PUA protection feature is set up properly, Windows Defender should automatically block and quarantine the provided program if you attempt to download it.



 
### How to remove quarantined files


Here’s how to remove quarantined files from your Windows Defender history:
1. On your Search bar, search for Windows Defender Security Center then click the Best match

2. On the new window that opens, click on Virus & threat protection

3. On the next section, click on Threat History

4. A list of all quarantined files will appear under Quarantined Threats

5. Click Remove to permanently remove the file.
Note: You can also restore and allow quarantined downloads in this section, but for your safety, proceed with caution!
