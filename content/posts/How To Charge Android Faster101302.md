### Unlock the Secret to Lightning Fast Android Charging - Never Wait for Battery Again!

Are you always on the go with your Android phone but constantly worried about your battery dying out? Well, worry no more. There is a secret to charging your Android phone faster than you ever thought possible.

First, it is important to note that the speed of charging your phone is dependent on the amount of power that goes into it. In simple terms, the more power you supply to your phone, the faster it will charge. With that in mind, here are some tips to help you unlock the secret to lightning-fast Android charging.

## Use the Right Charger

The charger that comes with your phone may not always be the best when it comes to charging your phone quickly. To achieve the fastest charging speeds, you need to invest in a charger that provides maximal wattage. Look for chargers that provide at least 15 watts of power output. These can be found in stores or online; just make sure it is compatible with your phone.

## Power off Your Phone

Did you know that your phone uses a significant amount of battery power even when it is switched off? This means that charging your phone while it is switched off is the most effective way to get a full battery fast. So, when charging your phone, turn it off completely to maximize charging speed.

## Use Airplane Mode

When your phone is connected to WIFI or cellular network, it uses a lot of power to stay connected. So when charging, switch your phone to airplane mode to cut off any cellular connectivity and speed up the charging process. You can also turn off other features like Bluetooth or GPS to reduce the battery drainers.

## Keep Your Phone Cool

Heat is the enemy of phone batteries. Your phone can't charge optimally when it is overheated. So, to optimize the charging speed, it’s important to keep your phone cool. You can do this by placing it in a cool area, like near an open window or fan if possible. Heating pads, direct sunlight, or placing your phone beneath a pillow or blanket must be avoided, as it increases the temperature and slows down the charging speed.

## Replace Your Battery

Sometimes, replacing the battery might be necessary to optimize charging speed, especially if your phone is old or has experienced wear and tear. After replacing the battery, you will notice faster charging times and a longer battery lifespan.

Bottom Line

Fast charging your Android phone isn’t rocket science. With the right charger, a few button clicks for airplane mode, and ensuring your device stays cool, it’s possible to get a full battery charge in a fraction of the time it takes while using a standard charger. Try these helpful tips, and you'll never have to wait around for your battery to charge again.

While many Android phones have made improvements in battery life, the way we use them can still drain them down. We stream video, play games, and crank up the brightness on our screens.
There are ways to shave some precious minutes off your Android charging time so you can free yourself from the tether of an outlet. These tips are perfect for those times when you’re about to rush out the door and need to get as much charge into your phone as possible.

 
### Shut it down


While it can be hard to keep your hands off your smartphone, shutting it down will help it charge faster. Turning the phone off entirely will remove the temptation to keep streaming, browsing, checking notifications, or using apps — activities that continue to suck up battery life while you’re trying to juice it back up.
Extend your phone’s battery life with these easy adjustments.

 
### Put it in airplane mode


If you can’t quite bring yourself to turn off your phone, then you can still set it into airplane mode to reduce any ongoing drain on the battery during charging. You can usually access this setting quickly by swiping down from the top of your screen, touching the downward arrow, and tapping the airplane mode icon.

 
### Fast-charge your phone


Some Android phones support fast-charging technologies. This tech appears under several different names. Qualcomm, which provides the chips for many Android phones, calls the tech “Quick Charge” and says it can charge your phone up to four times faster than conventional charging. Motorola calls its version Turbopower. Samsung’s high-end Galaxy phones have what’s called Adaptive Fast Charging.
If your phone is equipped with fast-charging technology, you will need to make sure you’re using the proper power charger to take full advantage of it. For example, the Moto G5 Plus, a popular budget smartphone, comes with Motorola’s Turbopower technology and includes a Turbopower charger. Motorola says it can get you up to six hours of battery life with just 15 minutes of charging. If you use a different charger, say one you’ve borrowed from an older phone or other device, you won’t get that same fast charge. So use the charger that came with the phone to get the best results.

 
### Update your system


Not all Android phones are eligible for the latest operating system releases, but be sure to upgrade to the most recent version you can and apply any patches Google makes available. A recent issue with certain Google Pixel phones highlights why this can be important.
Some Pixel and Pixel XL users discovered the fast-charging feature wasn’t working properly after the Android Pie update over the summer. Google finally released a fix in early October. Be sure to update if you have one of those phones, but keeping up on updates is smart for any Android owner.
If you often find yourself running low on battery while you’re out and about, then you might want to keep a portable battery pack handy to help you out.
Don’t let the battery blues get you down. While a phone with fast-charging tech is ideal, it also helps to get a phone with long battery life to begin with. Check out our look at the phones with the best batteries.
