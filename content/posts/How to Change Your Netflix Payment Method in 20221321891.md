# Revamp Your Wallet This New Year: Get The Ultimate Guide To Changing Your Netflix Payment Method in 2022!

If you're a Netflix subscriber, you might have set up automatic payments for your monthly subscription fee. While this is an easy way to stay on top of your payments, it can be easy to forget to update your payment method when your card expires or you want to switch payment methods. With the new year upon us, now is the perfect time to revamp your wallet and make sure your payment information is up-to-date. 

Luckily, changing your Netflix payment method is a simple process that can be done in just a few steps. Here's the ultimate guide to changing your Netflix payment method in 2022:

Step 1: Log into your Netflix account

The first step to changing your payment method is to log into your Netflix account. You can do this by going to Netflix.com and entering your email and password.

Step 2: Go to your account settings

Once you're logged in, click on your profile icon in the top right-hand corner of the page. From there, select "Account" from the drop-down menu.

Step 3: Click on "Update Payment Info"

On the account page, you'll see a section labeled "Membership & Billing." Under this section, click on the button that says "Update payment info."

Step 4: Enter your new payment information

You'll be taken to a page where you can enter your new payment information. You can choose to pay with a credit or debit card, or with PayPal. Enter your payment details, making sure to double-check that everything is correct.

Step 5: Save your new payment information

Once you've entered your new payment information, click the "Save" button. Netflix will update your payment information, and your next payment will be charged to your new payment method.

It's important to note that if you have another form of automatic payment set up, such as through iTunes or Amazon, you'll need to update your payment information through those platforms as well.

Revamping your wallet and changing your payment information on all your subscriptions is a great way to start the new year off on the right foot. Updating your Netflix payment method is quick and easy, so there's no reason to put it off any longer. Follow these steps, and you'll be ready to sit back, relax, and enjoy all the great content that Netflix has to offer!

Once charged, it may take a few days to appear the billing information in your account. However, the problem is that s users sometimes get a new debit/credit card and forget to update the billing details.
If you fail to update the new payment method on Netflix, the company will use your old payment method. So, if you just got a new debit/credit card, you need to update your payment preferences for subscriptions manually.
