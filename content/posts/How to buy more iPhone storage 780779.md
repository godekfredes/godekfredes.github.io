# Unlock the Secrets to Doubling Your iPhone Storage with These Easy Tips!

Running out of storage space on your iPhone can be a frustrating experience. It can limit your ability to download new apps, take photos, and even affect the performance of your device. Luckily, there are ways to double your iPhone storage space without the need for expensive upgrades. Follow these easy tips to unlock the secrets to doubling your iPhone storage.

## Tip #1: Delete Unnecessary Apps and Data

The first step to freeing up space on your iPhone is to delete unnecessary apps and data. Start by going through your home screen and deleting any apps that you rarely use or no longer need. You can also go to Settings > General > iPhone Storage to see what apps are taking up the most space on your device. Delete any unnecessary data, like old text message conversations, photos, and videos.

## Tip #2: Use iCloud Photo Library

If you're someone who takes a lot of photos and videos, consider using iCloud Photo Library. This service allows you to store all of your photos and videos in the cloud, freeing up space on your iPhone. You can still access your photos and videos anytime, anywhere, and even download them onto your device when you need to.

## Tip #3: Use External Storage Devices

Another way to double your iPhone storage space is to use external storage devices. You can use a flash drive or hard drive that's compatible with your iPhone to store files and photos. This way, you don't have to rely on your iPhone's internal storage to keep all of your important files.

## Tip #4: Use iTunes to Manage Your Music Library

If you have an extensive music library, consider using iTunes to manage your music files. You can opt to only keep your favorite songs on your iPhone and stream the rest of your music using the cloud or a streaming service. This can save you a lot of storage space on your device.

## Tip #5: Offload Unused Apps

Offloading unused apps is another great way to save storage space on your device. This feature allows you to delete the app from your device while keeping its data stored. You can easily reinstall the app in the future if you need it again.

In conclusion, doubling your iPhone storage space is easier than you think. By following these easy tips, you can free up space on your device and prevent storage issues from slowing down your iPhone's performance. Start today and experience the benefits of having more storage space on your iPhone.

As soon as a squishy little creature, furry or not, enters your home, you can kiss all your free storage goodbye, and just watch as your Photos app gets filled with new memories.  
However, where there's a will, there's a way. If you'd like to keep your data at your fingertips and want to buy more storage for your iPhone, you have the option to go with cloud servers, through an iCloud+ or OneDrive subscription.

Though iCloud+ is Apple's proprietary cloud service, you can also expand your iPhone storage through a OneDrive subscription, which is what I prefer to do.

After that, simply tap on Buy More Storage or Change Storage Plan.
The different iCloud+ plans are laid out below, but keep in mind that you can also get 200GB of storage with an Apple One plan.

The Apple One plan features 50GB, 200GB, or 2TB of iCloud storage, plus Apple Music, Apple TV+, and Apple Arcade, with options for Apple News+ and Fitness+. Prices range from $16.95 to $22.95 and $32.95 monthly. Our family likes the extra TV and music perks, so the $22.95-per-month plan is a good fit for us.

A Microsoft 365 Family subscription for $99.99 not only gives you and household members access to Microsoft Office apps, like Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Teams, but it also includes 1TB of OneDrive storage per person for up to six people.   
Once you have your subscription set up, simply download the OneDrive app from the Apple App Store to begin uploading your iPhone camera roll to OneDrive. You can even turn on Bedtime Backup to have OneDrive automatically back up your new photos and videos when your phone is connected to power while you sleep.  

 
##   How can I avoid paying for more storage? 


To avoid paying for cloud storage when your iPhone is full, you can always go through your phone and delete anything that you don't need any more or any apps that you aren't using. It may also be time to back up your iPhone to a Mac, for example, to offload photos and videos, while keeping them safely stored. Another way to avoid paying for more storage is to make sure you're taking advantage of your free iCloud space.  
When you first buy an iPhone or other Apple product, you set up an Apple ID. This is your Apple account that contains all your information, settings, contacts, app history, and even your subscriptions -- it's all in one place. Your Apple ID gives you access to 5GB of free iCloud storage for anything from photos and videos to files and app data.   
If you go to your iPhone's settings and tap on your name at the top, you can access your iCloud settings and see how your iCloud storage is being used.   

 
##   What's the difference between device storage and cloud storage?  


Internal storage or device storage is the finite amount of storage space included within your device. iPhones come with a set amount of storage, like 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1,024GB. This means that once all this storage space is full, the new photos and videos will have nowhere to go, so you'll need to do something about it, either delete data or upgrade to a cloud subscription. Device storage also means that you can only access your photos and videos using that device.  
Cloud storage, on the other hand, is when data is stored on a company's cloud servers and typically involves a subscription, like iCloud+. Cloud storage means that your data can be uploaded from your iPhone to the cloud using your account, and you can delete it from your phone or keep low-quality versions of it that occupy less device storage.

 
##   Can I expand iPhone storage?  


Unfortunately, you can't expand the iPhone's internal memory with a flash card. The only way to expand the storage on your iPhone is to use a cloud service like iCloud+ or OneDrive, or by upgrading to a newer iPhone with more storage.
