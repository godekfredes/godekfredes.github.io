Thumbnails for your files on Windows 11 were generated automatically to show you a preview of the media files or document. This saves you the need to rename or open files to know what’s inside them. Whenever you open a folder containing images, videos, or documents, Windows 11 picks the thumbnail directly from the thumbnail database and shows it to you.
While the functionality is useful, the thumbnail cache is prone to corruption. If the thumbnail cache file gets corrupted due to some reason, the file thumbnails won’t load, and you will face missing thumbnail issues. If you are already dealing with thumbnail-related problems on your Windows 11, the chances are that the thumbnail cache database has become too large or it’s corrupted.
