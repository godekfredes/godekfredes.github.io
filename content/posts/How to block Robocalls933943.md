Say Goodbye to Annoying Robocalls Forever with This Simple Trick!

Are you tired of being interrupted by incessant robocalls? These phone calls are automated, with pre-recorded messages, and often come from shady marketers or scammers. They can be so frustrating that Americans reportedly receive around 5 billion robocalls every month. Fortunately, there is a simple trick that can help you say goodbye to these annoying calls forever.

The trick is to use a call-blocking app. Call-blocking apps use algorithms to detect and reject robocalls. Most of these apps are free, and they are easy to install on both Android and iOS phones. Many of them even have a user-friendly interface that allows you to easily manage your calls and block any unwanted ones.

One popular call-blocking app is RoboKiller. This app uses AI-powered algorithms to detect and block unwanted calls before they reach your phone. RoboKiller also has a feature that plays a pre-recorded message to the caller, which can discourage them from calling back. Another great app is Nomorobo, which has been rated as the best call-blocking app by numerous tech websites. Nomorobo uses a database of known spam numbers to prevent unwanted calls from reaching your phone.

Using a call-blocking app is a simple and effective way to say goodbye to robocalls forever. However, there are a few things to keep in mind if you want to get the most out of your app. Firstly, make sure to keep the app updated, as scammers are constantly finding new ways to bypass these tools. Secondly, be careful not to block any important calls from friends or family members. It’s also a good idea to customize your blocking settings and blacklist any specific numbers or area codes that are consistently harassing you.

In conclusion, if you’re tired of being interrupted by robocalls, it's time to take control of your phone. Don't let unwanted calls consume your time and energy, install a call-blocking app and say goodbye to robocalls forever! With this simple and effective trick, you can free yourself from this incessant annoyance and enjoy a peaceful and uninterrupted life.

How can you stop these annoying phone calls? Signing up with the Do Not Call registry is a good step. However, this won’t stop every call. Luckily, there is another step you can take. This unique service blocks illegal robocalls.
The service is called Nomorobo and it lets the phone ring once, then identifies the caller. If the caller is a robot telemarketer, it automatically hangs up for you. It also blocks robotic calls people report as illegal, so you won’t miss a doctor’s appointment reminder, a school call or a weather alert.
Nomorobo is free to use for 30 days, after that it costs $1.99 per month or $19.99 for an entire year. To sign up, you will need to provide Nomorobo with some information. List the type of phone you have – wireless or landline – and select your carrier.
Note: Not all major cell carriers support Nomorobo. However, it is working to partner with the major cell services. If you enter a wireless provider, the site will give you instructions on how you can help get Nomorobo into the fold.
Nomorobo will also need a valid email address to contact you with updates and other information. If your carrier supports Nomorobo, you will receive an email with a link. Click the link and you will go to the Nomorobo signup page. Enter your first and last name and create a password to create an account.
After you create your account, Nomorobo will walk you through setting it up on your phone. It’s a simple, one-time setup that will keep those annoying robot callers off your phone for good.

 
## Another option


However, if your carrier doesn’t support Nomorobo, you can check out the TrueCaller app. It lets you find out who’s behind that unknown number. Just copy and paste the number then throw it in the search bar embedded in the app. Truecaller will then search the unknown number to find out who it is. There are more than 1.6 billion numbers in the database, so Truecaller should have no problem identifying the caller for you.
Another great feature of Truecaller is its ability to block spam calls. When a pesky telemarketer calls, there will be a big warning in red telling you that it’s a spam call. Simply swipe up when this happens to automatically block that caller and add them to the spam list.
Truecaller will also fill in any missing details about someone already in your contacts lists, for example, it might add a person’s Twitter handle. It will also show you how you are connected to that person.
