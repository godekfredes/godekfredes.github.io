## How to change Alexa's voice on your smartphone
 
Estimated time: 2-3 minutes
 
### Step 1: Open the Alexa app on your smartphone
 
### Step 2: Go to the Devices tab and find "Echo & Alexa"


Within the Devices tab, you should see an option on the top left named Echo & Alexa. This is the section where you can control your Echo-branded devices, including Echo smart speakers, Echo Show smart displays, and more. It's also where you can control the settings for your individual devices, including their assigned voice.

 
### Step 3: Find the device you want to modify


Within the Echo & Alexa section, you'll see a list of all registered Echo-branded devices with their assigned names. You'll want to find the specific device you want to modify and tap on it. In this case, I'm using a second-generation Echo Dot, which I've named "Study," as an example. 

 
### Step 4: Open your Echo's Settings page


Once you've opened the page for the specific device you're modifying, you'll see its Bluetooth connections, Alarms & Timers, current status, and more, depending on the device type. We only need to focus on the gear icon in the top right of the screen (circled in red below). Tap the gear icon to enter the settings page for that specific device.

 
### Step 5: Scroll down and tap on Alexa's Voice


Within the Device Settings menu, you'll need to scroll down a bit to find the option named "Alexa's Voice." It should be located right below "Wake Word," which you can tap on while you're in this menu, if you'd like to also change the wake word your Echo responds to. 

 
### Step 6: Choose your voice


Now that we've made it to the Alexa's Voice page for the device in question, you can select either Original or New. "New" is the more recently-introduced male option for Alexa. Tapping it will play a short example of how Alexa will sound with that voice active. If you don't like the new option, you can revert to Original with a second tap. Once you've chosen, the device you modified will continue using whichever voice you selected until you change it again.

### Step 1: Go to the Echo you want to modify and issue the necessary voice command


This even easier way to toggle between the "Original" female voice and the "New" male option just requires the Echo device itself. Simply go to the device and say "Alexa, change your voice." If you had it set to Original, it will switch to the new male voice and respond with an example of how it will sound. If you have it set to New, it will revert to original and demonstrate the classic female voice. You can switch up and back at any time by re-issuing the same command.

### Step 1: Ask for an introduction...


Go to any of your Echo devices, or open the Alexa app and say "Alexa, introduce me to [insert name of chose celebrity from the list above here]." Alexa will switch to the "Celebrity Personality" you chose, and will explain, in their voice, what they're capable of. 

 
### Step 2: Confirm your purchase
 
### Step 3: Access your celebrity voice

Note: Some older devices, like the original Echo, may have fewer options available. 
In the meantime, you can access several skills that will allow your Echo to have varying levels of interaction with you in other famous voices, like R2D2 and Darth Vader from Star Wars, Gordon Ramsay, or Baby Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy.
