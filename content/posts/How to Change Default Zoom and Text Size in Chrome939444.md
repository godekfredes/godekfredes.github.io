2. Click on "Settings."
3. Scroll down and click on "Advanced."
4. Look for the "Page zoom" option under "Web content," and adjust the zoom level by clicking on the "+" or "-" sign.

## Custom Text Size

While zooming in or out can help to increase or decrease text size, it may also affect the layout of the website. If you want to avoid this, you can adjust the text size instead. Here's how:

### 1. Browser Settings

1. Click on the three dots located in the upper-right corner of Chrome.
2. Click on "Settings."

If you want more control over the text size, you can also use Chrome extensions. Here are some popular options:

- **Font Size Changer:** This extension allows you to customize the font size of any web page while maintaining the overall layout. It also offers a convenient toolbar button for easy access.
- **Zoom Text Only:** This extension enables you to zoom in or out on text only, instead of the entire page. It’s ideal for those who want to avoid layout changes and only adjust the text size. 

## Conclusion
