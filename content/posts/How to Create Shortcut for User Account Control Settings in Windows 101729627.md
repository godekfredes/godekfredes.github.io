# Unlock Hidden Windows 10 Setting with This Simple Trick - Shortcuts for User Account Control Settings Revealed!

Are you looking for a way to get more control over your Windows 10 computer? If so, then you need to check out the User Account Control settings. This powerful feature can help you protect your system from unauthorized access and changes, but it can be difficult to find and customize without some extra knowledge. In this article, we'll reveal a simple trick for unlocking hidden Windows 10 settings, so you can take full advantage of User Account Control and other features.

## Understanding User Account Control

When you first set up your Windows 10 computer, you probably didn't think too much about User Account Control (UAC). This feature is designed to prevent malicious software or unauthorized users from making changes to your PC without your knowledge or consent. When UAC is enabled, you'll be prompted to enter your password or confirm a request before certain programs or settings can be accessed.

While UAC can be a useful security feature, it can also be somewhat annoying if you're constantly being prompted for permission. If you want to use your computer the way you want to without any interruptions, you can disable UAC. But before you do that, you might want to take a closer look at the settings to see if there's a way to tweak them to your liking.

## Accessing Hidden Settings

There are many hidden settings in Windows 10 that can't be accessed by default. But if you know the right keyboard shortcuts, you can unlock these settings and gain more control over your PC. Here's how to reveal the User Account Control settings:

1. Open the Start menu and type "cmd" into the search bar.
2. Right-click on Command Prompt and select "Run as administrator."
3. In the Command Prompt window, type "control userpasswords2" and press Enter.
4. This will bring up the User Accounts dialog box. Click on the "User Account Control Settings" link at the bottom of the screen.

Voila! You've now accessed the hidden User Account Control settings menu, where you can adjust the level of UAC protection and notification settings. From here, you can choose to always notify or never notify before changes are made, or opt for the recommended setting of "Notify me only when apps try to make changes to my computer."

## Other Keyboard Shortcuts

Now that you know how to access the hidden User Account Control settings, you might be wondering what other shortcuts are available. Here are a few that can help you unlock additional Windows 10 features:

- Windows key + X: This opens the "Power User" menu, where you can access a variety of tools and settings.
- Windows key + I: This opens the Settings app, where you can customize many aspects of your Windows 10 experience.
- Windows key + A: This opens the Action Center, where you can quickly access notifications and settings.

By using these keyboard shortcuts, you can save time and unlock hidden Windows 10 settings that you may not have known existed. From managing your User Account Control settings to accessing the Power User menu, these simple tricks can help you get more out of your PC.

## Conclusion

With Windows 10, Microsoft has added many new features to help users customize their computers and protect their privacy. However, some of these features can be difficult to find and customize without some extra knowledge. By using the keyboard shortcuts outlined in this article, you can unlock hidden Windows 10 settings and gain more control over your PC.
