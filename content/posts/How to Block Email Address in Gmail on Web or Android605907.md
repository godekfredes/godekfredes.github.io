Spam emails are more than just a nuisance; they can put your data and privacy at risk. The good news is that Gmail offers a straightforward and practical way to stop spam emails from reaching your inbox. In this article, we'll take a look at how to block email addresses on Gmail.

Why Do You Need to Block Email Addresses on Gmail?

Spam emails come in various forms and can be harmful in different ways. Some spam emails are advertisements that clutter your inbox, while others are phishing attempts that aim to steal your personal information. A phishing email can trick you into clicking a malicious link, downloading malware, or giving away sensitive information such as login credentials.

Gmail provides a tool that allows you to block an email address entirely, preventing any emails from that address from making it to your inbox. This is an effective way to stop unwanted spam emails from bothering you, minimizing the risks posed by phishing scams.

How to Block an Email Address on Gmail – Step by Step

Here are the steps you need to follow to block an email address on Gmail.

Step 1: Log in to Your Gmail Account

Find the email you want to block in your Gmail inbox. Open it and look at the top right corner of the email. You will see three dots; click on them.

Step 3: Click on "Block [sender]"

A pop-up box will appear, giving you the option to "Block" the sender. If you click on the 'Block,' Gmail will move all future emails from that address directly to the Spam folder.

Step 4: Confirm the Action

After you click "Block," a confirmation message will appear. If you're sure that you want to block all messages from that email address, click "Block."

Step 5: Unblock If Necessary

If you decide later that you want to unblock the sender, go to the "Settings" menu, select "Filters and Blocked Addresses," and find the sender's details. Click "Unblock" to remove the restriction.

In Summary

Blocking an email address on Gmail is a useful feature that helps keep your email inbox safe and clean.
