As the old saying goes, time is money. And in today's fast-paced world, it's more important than ever to make the most of every minute. One of the key tools for successful time management is a reliable calendar. And one of the most widely used calendar tools is Google Calendars. But did you know that you can create multiple calendars within your Google account? This little-known feature is a game-changer for those who need to keep track of multiple projects, schedules, or teams. Here's how to unlock the power of time management by creating multiple Google calendars.

### Step 1: Sign in to your Google account

Assuming you already have a Google account, go to Google.com and sign in.

### Step 2: Access Google Calendar

Once you're signed in, click on the "Apps" icon in the upper-right corner of the screen. Then click on the "Calendar" icon. This will take you to your Google Calendar.

### Step 3: Create a new calendar

To create a new calendar, click on the "+ Create new calendar" button on the left side of the screen. A form will appear, asking for the name, description, and time zone of your new calendar. Fill in the required fields and click "Create Calendar."

### Step 4: Customize your calendar

Once your new calendar is created, you can customize it by adding events, changing the color, and adjusting the visibility settings. You can also choose to share your calendar with others, which is useful if you're working on a project with a team.

### Step 5: Repeat as needed

You can create as many calendars as you need, depending on your needs. For example, you might create separate calendars for personal and work events, different projects or clients, or individual team members.

### Step 6: View your calendars

To view your multiple calendars, click on the drop-down arrow next to the name of your main calendar. From there, you can toggle the visibility of each calendar on or off, depending on what you want to see.

### Step 7: Sync your calendars

If you're using Google Calendar on multiple devices (such as a phone and computer), you'll want to make sure your calendars are synced. To do this, go to the Settings menu (the gear icon in the upper-right corner of the screen), click on "Mobile Setup," and follow the instructions to sync your calendars.

By creating multiple Google calendars, you'll be able to stay on top of all your commitments, deadlines, and projects with ease. And best of all, you can customize each calendar to suit your specific needs, whether that means color-coding, sharing, or hiding certain events. So why not give it a try and see how it can transform your time management game?

But why would you need multiple calendars? The answer to this is simple: Flexibility. It's not just about being better organized but having the ability to configure each calendar differently. For example, you might want to set one calendar for popup notifications and another for email notifications. You might want to share access to one calendar while keeping another private.
Regardless of why you want to add more calendars to your Google account, I'm here to show you how. 

 
## Requirements


The only things you'll need for this are a working Google account and a web browser (as you cannot add calendars from the mobile app). Google Calendar is supported by nearly all browsers, so you can do this from Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Vivaldi, Safari, Edge, or even GNOME Web.
With everything at the ready, let's create a new calendar.

 
## Creating a new Google Calendar


Now, when you go to create a new event in Google Calendar, you'll have the option to select that new calendar.
Make sure to select that new calendar for any related event, so you can not only enjoy an improved organization but the specific configurations for that calendar (such as notifications). 
I've been using multiple calendars in Google for years and it's been a real time saver for me. Not only does it keep me better organized, but it also helps to prevent me from missing out on events specific to a client or business.
