Tap on install, and the font will be installed on your device.

Step 3: Set the Font

Now that you have installed the font, the final step is to set it as your device's font. You can do this in the Display settings of your device. To access the Display settings, go to Settings > Display. Look for the option that says Font or Font Size, and tap on it. You should see a list of available fonts on your device. Select the font you want to use, and your device's font will be changed.

Conclusion:
