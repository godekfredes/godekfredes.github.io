Introduction
Windows 11, the latest version of Microsoft's operating system, has introduced several new improvements and features. Among them are changes to the Task Manager, particularly the ability to identify admin processes. In this article, we will dive deeper and uncover the secret trick to identify admin processes on Windows 11.

Understanding Admin Processes
Admin processes refer to the background processes that are initiated and run by the administrator account. These processes are usually critical to the functioning of the operating system and are not visible to regular users. However, certain malicious programs can also hide themselves as admin processes to avoid detection and carry out their nefarious activities.

Identifying Admin Processes on Windows 11
Fortunately, Windows 11 comes with an improved Task Manager that allows users to identify admin processes. To do so, follow these simple steps:

Step 1: Open Task Manager by pressing the Ctrl + Shift + Esc keys simultaneously, or by right-clicking on the taskbar and selecting "Task Manager" from the menu.

Step 2: On the Task Manager window, click on the "Details" tab to view the list of all running processes.

Step 3: Right-click on any of the column headings, such as "Name," "PID," or "CPU," and select "Security" from the menu.

Step 4: This will add a new column to the list, labeled "Integrity Level." This column will display the integrity level of the process - whether it is low, medium, or high.

Step 5: Admin processes always have a high integrity level. Therefore, scroll through the list and look for any processes with a high integrity level. These are admin processes, and you should investigate them further if they seem suspicious.

Expert Tips to Spot Malicious Admin Processes
While the above trick can help you identify admin processes, it may not always be foolproof. To spot malicious admin processes, follow the expert tips below:

Tip 1: Check the publisher - look for processes from trusted publishers, such as Microsoft or other reputable software companies. If you see a suspicious publisher, investigate further.

Tip 2: Look for processes with generic file names - if a process has a generic file name, such as "svc.exe" or "dllhost.exe," be cautious as it could be a malicious process masquerading as a legitimate one.

Tip 3: Watch out for unusual behavior - if a process is consuming an unusually high amount of CPU or memory resources, or connecting to unfamiliar network addresses, it could be a sign of a malicious process.

Conclusion
Identifying admin processes on Windows 11 is crucial in maintaining the security and integrity of your system. By following the simple steps outlined above, you can easily spot admin processes and investigate any suspicious activity. However, it's important to remember that this trick is not foolproof and to rely on expert tips to spot malicious admin processes. Stay vigilant and protect your system from potential threats.
