If you are still using Microsoft Edge in Windows 11, it's time for a wake-up call! While Edge is a decent browser, it might not be your preferred choice. Most people have other browsers that they like more than Edge.

Fortunately, switching to your preferred browser in Windows 11 is a straightforward process. In this article, we'll show you how to make the switch.

Before we dive into the steps, let's take a quick look at some reasons why people prefer other browsers over Edge.

- More features: Other browsers have more features than Edge, such as extension support, customizability, and better privacy protection.

- Compatibility: Some websites might not work well with Edge, forcing users to switch to other browsers to access those sites.

- Personal preference: Some people just prefer other browsers. Maybe they've been using them for years or like the user interface better.

Now that we've covered the reasons why you might want to switch to another browser, let's get into the steps.

Step 1: Download your preferred browser

The first step is to download the browser you want to use. The most popular browsers are Chrome, Firefox, and Opera, but you can use any browser you prefer.

Go to the browser's official website and download the installation file. Once downloaded, run the file to install the browser on your computer.

Step 2: Set your preferred browser as default

After installing the browser, you need to set it as the default browser.

Here's how to do it:

1. Click the Start button and select Settings.

2. Click on Apps.

3. Select Default apps from the left-hand side menu.

4. Scroll down to the Web browser section and select the browser you want to use.

5. Close the Settings window.

That's it! Your preferred browser is now set as the default browser, and any links you click on will open in the new browser.

Step 3: Import bookmarks and other settings

If you've been using Edge for some time, you might have saved bookmarks or other settings that you want to keep. Most browsers make it easy to import bookmarks and other settings from your old browser.

Here's how to do it for Chrome:

1. Open Chrome.

2. Click on the three-dot menu icon in the top right corner.

3. Select Bookmarks, then Import bookmarks and settings.

4. Choose Microsoft Edge from the dropdown menu.

5. Select the items you want to import and click Import.

That's it! Your bookmarks and other settings should now be available in Chrome.

Conclusion:

Switching from Edge to your preferred browser in Windows 11 doesn't have to be complicated. Follow the simple steps outlined in this article, and you'll be up and running in no time. Remember, using your preferred browser can make your browsing experience more enjoyable and efficient. So, what are you waiting for? Start making the switch today!

In Summary


Windows 11 will debut on 5th October for the public.
Microsoft has made changing the default browser process a bit complicated and a lengthy process when compared to Windows 10.
Today, we will have a look at how you can change the default browser from Microsoft Edge to any third-party browser.







While the new design elements are aimed at improving the user experience, there is still much to be said about the change in default browser settings in Windows 11 (Beta).
Unlike in the past, Microsoft has made changing the default browser a somewhat complicated and lengthy process compared to Windows 10. Today we will take a look at how you can change the default browser from Microsoft Edge to any third-party browser.

 
## Steps to change the default browser in Windows 11


For this article, we will use Google Chrome as a reference. The steps to change the default browser are the same for all browsers.
1. Open the start menu and search for default apps.
2. After opening default apps settings, scroll down in apps until you see the browser.
3. Now, choose the browser you want to set as default. Let’s say you want to set Google Chrome as your default browser on Windows 11, then choose Google Chrome from the list of apps.

4. Here, you will see many options but do not get confused. Click on .htm and choose switch anyways.

5. From the drop-down menu, click on Google Chrome, and you are done.

6. Do the same for all other options, and boom, you have successfully changed the default browser on Windows 11.
Though it seemed a pretty straightforward process, the fact that you need it to change for every single option is not a pleasant experience compared to changing only one setting on Windows 10.

 
## But why is it so complicated compared to Windows 10?


Yes, the process is comparatively longer and more complicated than Windows 10, but we have to keep in mind that Windows 11 is still in beta. So there is a possibility that some design elements are not finalized yet. That being said, with a public release in just four weeks, we are not very confident that this issue will be fixed soon. We hope that Microsoft will take users’ feedback into account and simplify the process before the final release.

 
## But do you actually need to switch from Microsoft Edge?


In 2020, Microsoft released a new version of Microsoft Edge to the public to take on popular third-party browsers like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Microsoft has completely redesigned the browser and added some of the most requested features. Let us take a look at some of these features.

 
### 1. Installing websites as apps


One unique feature in the new Microsoft Edge browser is the ability to install websites as apps. This can come in very handy if you visit a particular website quite frequently. Let us have a look at how to do use this feature.

 

Open Microsoft Edge and visit your favorite website.
Once the website is loaded, click on the three-dotted menu in the top right.
Now, in the drop-down list, look for the apps option.
Click on apps and choose to install this website as an app.
Boom, it will now install the website as an app on your PC/Laptop.

 
### 2. Ability to use Chrome extensions on Edge


One of the prime reasons people prefer using Google Chrome is the Chrome web store. Chrome Webstore has a truckload of extensions compared to other browsers. But did you know the tech giant added the ability to use third-party browser extensions directly in Microsoft Edge? Let us have a look at how you can do just that.

 

Open Microsoft Edge and click on the three-doted menu in the top right corner.
Choose extensions from the drop-down menu.
Now, look for the “allow extensions from other stores” option in the bottom left corner and enable it.
Once enabled, you can download and access extensions from third-party extension stores like the Chrome web store.
