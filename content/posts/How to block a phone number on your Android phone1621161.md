Have you ever received a call from an unknown number while you're in the middle of an important task or just trying to relax? Or maybe you're tired of receiving spam calls or telemarketer calls that disrupt your day? If you own an Android phone, there's good news- you can take back control of your cell by learning how to block annoying calls.

In this article, we will provide step-by-step instructions on how to block unwanted callers on your Android phone.

Step 1: Identify the number you want to block

The first step in blocking a call on your Android phone is to identify the offending number. You can find the number in your call log, contacts list or by using a caller ID app.

Step 2: Add the number to your block list

Once you have identified the number you want to block, you need to add it to your block list. Here's how to do it:

Option 1: From the Phone app

1. Open the Phone app on your Android device.
2. Locate the number you want to block, either in your recent calls list or your contacts.
3. Tap and hold the number.
4. Select Block number or add to reject list.

Option 2: From Settings

1. Open the Settings app on your Android phone.
2. Scroll down and tap on "Call settings", then select "Call rejection".
3. Tap on "Auto reject list" and then click on the plus sign in the top right corner.
4. Enter the phone number you want to block and save.

Step 3: Confirm the number is blocked

To make sure the number you added to your block list is now being blocked, you can try calling from another phone or by asking a friend to call you. If an incoming call is blocked, you will see a notification showing that a call was rejected.

Step 4: Manage your block list

Over time, you may find that you need to remove or add numbers to your block list. To manage your block list, simply follow these steps:

1. Open the Phone app on your Android phone.
2. Tap the three-dot menu icon in the top right corner.
3. Select "Blocked numbers" to view your list of blocked numbers.
4. To remove a number, tap and hold the number, then select "Remove from blocked numbers".

Conclusion

With these simple steps, you can take back control of your Android phone and block unwanted callers. Whether you're looking to block spam calls, telemarketers or just annoying people, this guide will help you do it easily and quickly. So go ahead and unlock the power to control your cell today!

There’s a better way. th just a few steps you can banish that caller from contacting you forever. Here’s how to do it.
As a caveat, your specific dialer may look different or have some of the options placed elsewhere depending on which device you have. By  large, however, the process is pretty similar.
If it’s someone who called you recently, go to the dialer  then touch the three-dot menu button. Then touch Select. 
Choose the offending caller   then again touch the menu, this time choosing Add to Auto reject list. Now your phone should automatically block the number when they call again.
You can also block a caller by heading to the contacts app  making the same selection from the drop-down menu.
If you change your mind, find that same number again  choose Remove from Auto reject list. Though if you do that, get ready for more fantastic offers you’ll want to refuse.
