# Turn Your Trash into Treasure: Learn How to Transform an Old Shoebox into a High-Tech Smartphone Projector!

In the age of technology, entertainment has become more accessible than ever. With just a few clicks on our smartphones or laptops, we can access a vast array of movies, TV shows, and videos. However, there's something unique and satisfying about projecting a movie on a large screen that you can't get from watching on a small device. Unfortunately, buying a projector can be expensive, and not everyone can afford it. But, what if we told you that you could make your own projector with just an old shoebox? In this article, we'll guide you through the process of making a high-tech smartphone projector from scratch.

## Materials

Before you begin, you'll need to gather some materials. Fortunately, most of the items you need are readily available in your house.

* Shoebox
* Magnifying glass
* Black construction paper
* Scissors
* Ruler
* Glue
* Tape
* Pencil
* Smartphone

## Instructions

1. Start by cutting off the top of the shoebox and leaving a rectangular opening on one side. Make sure the opening is big enough for your phone to fit in.

2. Next, cut a piece of black construction paper to fit the size of the rectangular opening. Glue it on the inside of the shoebox, covering the opening.

3. Using a ruler, measure the distance from the magnifying glass to the black construction paper. Mark this distance on the top of the shoebox.

4. Cut a hole on the top of the box using the markings. The hole should be the exact size of the magnifying glass.

5. Place the magnifying glass on the hole and secure it by using tape or glue.

6. Cut two rectangular pieces of cardboard that are slightly smaller than the opening on the shoebox's other side. These pieces will function as the projectors' stand.

7. Glue the two cardboard pieces on the side of the rectangular opening to secure your phone.

8. Insert your phone into the cardboard stand, and position it in a way that the screen is facing the magnifying glass.

And there you have it, your very own smartphone projector! Turn off the lights, fire up your favorite movie or TV show, and project it onto a blank wall or projector screen. With this projector, you can now enjoy a home movie theater experience without breaking the bank.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, creating a high-tech smartphone projector from an old shoebox is a simple and cheap way to enjoy the big-screen experience at home.
