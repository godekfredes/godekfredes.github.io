The video bitrate is the most critical information that matters when it comes to streaming video quality.\nBy checking the video’s bitrate, you can determine whether the video is streaming in high definition or standard definition. You can also see if the video is buffering because of low internet speed or if there’s an issue with the video’s source.\nThe ability to check the video’s bitrate in VLC is a game-changer for streaming enthusiasts.
