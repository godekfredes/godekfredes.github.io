If you’re an LG G4 owner, you’re in luck. This Android phone is packed with features to make your life easier, and the notification panel is no exception. With a few simple hacks, you can customize your notification panel to suit your personal preferences and make it even more useful.\nStep 1: Get to Know Your Notification Panel Before you can customize your notification panel, it’s important to understand what it does. The notification panel is the area at the top of your screen that shows notifications for things like text messages, missed calls, and new emails. It’s also where you can access quick settings, like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and toggle features on and off.\nTo access your notification panel, swipe down from the top of your screen with one finger. If you want to see more settings, swipe down again with two fingers.\nStep 2: Rearrange Your Quick Settings By default, the quick settings in your notification panel are arranged in a certain order. But did you know you can rearrange them to your liking? To do so, swipe down twice with two fingers to access the full list of quick settings.\nPress and hold on any quick setting to select it. Then, drag it to where you want it to appear. You can also remove quick settings by dragging them to the trash can icon.\nStep 3: Add or Remove Quick Settings If there’s a quick setting you use frequently that isn’t already in your notification panel, you can easily add it. To do so, swipe down twice with two fingers to access the full list of quick settings.\nAt the bottom of the list, tap the “Edit” button. From there, you can drag any quick setting to the top of the list to make it appear in your notification panel.\nIf you want to remove a quick setting from your notification panel, simply drag it to the trash can icon.\nStep 4: Customize Your Notification Icons When you receive a notification on your LG G4, you’ll see an icon appear in your notification panel. These icons can be helpful, but they can also be confusing if you don’t know what they mean. Fortunately, you can customize them to make them more helpful.\nTo do so, swipe down twice with two fingers to access the quick settings. Then, tap the “Edit” button at the bottom of the list.\nFrom there, you can tap on any of the icons to change them. For example, you can change the email icon to show the sender’s name or the subject line of the email.\nStep 5: Change the Color of Your Notification Panel Lastly, if you want to give your LG G4 a little extra personalization, you can change the color of your notification panel. To do so, go to Settings \u003e Display \u003e Home screen \u003e Notification panel.\nFrom there, you can choose from several color options, including black, white, and gray.\nBy customizing your notification panel with these easy hacks, you can make your LG G4 even more powerful and convenient to use. Give it a try and see how much easier your life can be!\nWith the LG G3 last year, the Korean company gave its UX a major overhaul and it less of an eye sore. This year, building on the new aesthetics of its UI, LG went ahead and removed a plethora of unwanted features from its UX to simplify things further on the G4. One area where LG’s UX greatly differs from stock Android is in the notification bar though. The company has completely removed Quick Settings as implemented by Google and instead offers quick toggles right in the notification shade. It can be argued that by putting the toggles right in the notification shade, LG is wasting precious screen estate that could have been used to display more notifications, but it does make reaching the toggles easier using one hand on a 5.5-inch display. Nonetheless, one of the advantages of LG’s implementation is that the quick toggles in the notification shade can be easily customised. Here’s how. Step 1: Pull down the notification bar on your LG G4 to reveal the quick tiles. Swipe left on the toggles to reach the end of the list where you will find the ‘Edit’ button. Step 2: From the menu that opens up, select the tiles that you want to be displayed on the notification bar. You can drag ‘n’ drop the items to re-arrange them according to your liking. Step 3: You can also enable/disable the brightness and volume sliders from the notification slider from here. Once you have enabled, disabled and rearranged the quick tiles according to your liking, simply tap the back button to save your changes and exit the menu. The toggles in the notification bar will now be displayed as selected and rearranged by you. Do you like LG’s implementation of the quick settings over stock Android?
