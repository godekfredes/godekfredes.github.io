If you own a Windows 11 PC, you must know how it is essential to keep an eye on your CPU temperature. High temperatures can lead to severe damage to your system, and you need to monitor it to keep your PC healthy. But how can you keep track of your CPU temperature in Windows 11?\nIn this article, we will explore some surprising ways to monitor your CPU temperature in Windows 11. We’ll also reveal a method that you won’t believe works so well, but it does! So, let’s dive in and find out!\nMethod #1: Use Task Manager One of the most straightforward methods to check the CPU temperature in Windows 11 is via the Task Manager. The Task Manager is a built-in utility in Windows that provides real-time information about your CPU usage, system performance, and more.\nTo access the Task Manager, right-click on the taskbar and select “Task Manager” from the menu. In the Task Manager window, click on the “Performance” tab, and you will see a dashboard showing your CPU, Memory, and Disk usage. You can also select the “CPU” tab to see more detailed information about your CPU.\nOn the CPU tab, you can find the current temperature of your CPU, along with other performance metrics like utilization, frequency, and more. Note that the “CPU temperature” option is only available if your CPU has a built-in temperature sensor.\nMethod #2: Use Core Temp Core Temp is a third-party application that provides real-time temperature monitoring for your CPU. It is a lightweight utility that doesn’t consume much system resources and is highly accurate.\nTo download and install Core Temp, go to their website and download the latest version. Once downloaded, run the installer, and follow the on-screen instructions to install the application. After installation, launch the application, and it will automatically detect your CPU and start monitoring its temperature.\nCore Temp provides real-time information about each CPU core’s temperature, including minimum and maximum temperature, load, and frequency. You can also customize the temperature warning level and set alarms to alert you when your CPU reaches a certain temperature.\nMethod #3: Use HWMonitor HWMonitor is another fantastic third-party tool that allows you to monitor your CPU temperature, as well as other hardware components like GPU, hard disk, and more. It is a portable software that doesn’t require installation, and you can run it from a USB drive or other external storage.\nTo use HWMonitor, download the latest version from their website and extract the files to any location you want. Double-click on the executable file to run the application, and it will display real-time hardware monitoring data.\nOn the main screen, you will find your CPU’s temperature, as well as other important parameters like voltage, clock speed, and more. You can also see the temperature and performance of other hardware components.\nMethod #4: Use BIOS/UEFI Another surprising way to monitor your CPU temperature is to check it directly from the BIOS/UEFI settings. The BIOS/UEFI settings are the computer’s low-level system settings that control the hardware and software of your computer.\nTo access the BIOS/UEFI settings, restart your computer and repeatedly press the appropriate key (usually F2 or Delete) while the computer is booting up. Once you’re in the BIOS/UEFI settings, look for the option to view the CPU temperature.\nNote that not all BIOS/UEFI versions provide the option to view CPU temperature in real-time. In that case, you can use other methods mentioned above to monitor your CPU temperature.\nConclusion\nMonitoring your CPU temperature is crucial to keeping your Windows 11 PC healthy and running smoothly. The methods mentioned above provide you with different ways to monitor your CPU temperature effectively. Whether you use the Task Manager, Core Temp, HWMonitor, or check directly from the BIOS/UEFI settings, you can rest assured that your CPU temperature is under control.\nTry out these methods and see which one works best for you. You might be surprised at how easy it is to monitor your CPU temperature in Windows 11!\nIf you use the Beta or Dev build of Windows 11, you may experience performance issues. At times, your PC might also experience BSOD errors, Black screen, driver compatibility issues, and more. While you can fix most of the problems quickly, the one thing that might trouble you is the CPU overheating. As you use your Windows 11 PC, the CPU accumulates heat, and if it gets overheated, it will fail.

By monitoring the CPU temperature, you will know when to put your system to rest or kill resource-intensive applications. Here are some of the best ways to check the CPU temperature on Windows 11.\n1) Using Speccy Speccy is a Piriform tool that provides you with a complete overview of your system hardware. You can use the Speccy application to check the CPU temperature on Windows 11. Here’s how to use the app.\nFirst, download the Speccy installation file on your Windows 11 computer.\nOnce installed, run the executable file and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.\nOnce installed, click on the Run Speccy button.\nNow, you will see the main interface of the application. To check the CPU temperature, you need to click on the CPU section on the left.\nNow, under the CPU details, check the Average Temperature.\nThat’s it! This is how you can check the CPU temperature on your Windows 11 computer.\n2) Using Open Hardware Monitor Open Hardware Monitor is another best third-party tool that shows you the CPU temperature. The tool is fully compatible with the latest Windows 11 operating system, and here’s how you can use it.\nFirst, download the Open Hardware Monitor ZIP file on your Windows 11. Once downloaded, extract the zip file.\nOpen the OpenHardwareMonitor folder and double click on the OpenHardwareMonitor executable file.\nThis is a portable tool; hence it runs without installation. When the program opens, select your processor.\nYou can see your CPU temperature under the Temperatures section.\nThat’s it! This is how you can use the Open Hardware Monitor to check CPU temperature on your Windows 11 PC.\n3) Check CPU temperature via BIOS/UEFI If you don’t want to install any third-party application, you need to access the BIOS/UEFI to check the CPU temperature. For that, follow some of the simple steps shared below.\nFirst, boot into Safe Mode and access the Advanced Boot screen. On the Advanced Boot screen, click on the Troubleshoot option. On the Troubleshoot screen, click on the UEFI Firmware Settings. Now, on the next screen, click on the Restart button. Look through the BIOS listing on the Firmware settings page and find the CPU core temperature section.\nBased on the motherboard type you are using, the BIOS/UEFI settings may differ. Compared to this method, the above two methods were easier to follow. So, this guide is about checking CPU temperature on Windows 11 PC. You can also use other third-party CPU Temperature monitor tools on your Windows to get the same info.
