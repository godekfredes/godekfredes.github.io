Among these features is a stylish lock screen clock that keeps the time front and center. While the default lock screen clock is great, you may want to change it to suit your personal preferences or match your wallpaper.\nFortunately, changing the lock screen clock on your Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is a simple process that can be done in just a few steps. In this article, we will guide you through the process of changing the lock screen clock on your Samsung Galaxy Note 8.\nStep 1: Access the Lock Screen Settings\nTo change the lock screen clock on your Samsung Galaxy Note 8, you need to first access the lock screen settings. There are different ways to do this, but the easiest way is to go to “Settings” from your home screen, scroll down and tap “Lock screen and security.” Once you’re there, select “Clock and FaceWidgets,” and then “Clock style.”\nStep 2: Choose the Clock Style\nNext, you will see a variety of clock styles to choose from. These include digital and analog clocks, as well as a variety of fonts, colors, and backgrounds. Scroll through the options until you find one that you like. You can tap on each clock style to see a preview of how it will look on your lock screen.\nStep 3: Customize the Clock Style\nOnce you have selected a clock style, you may want to customize it further. For example, you can change the color of the clock, the font size, and the background. These options will vary depending on the clock style you have chosen.\nStep 4: Preview and Save\nBefore you save your new lock screen clock, it’s a good idea to preview how it will look on your lock screen. To do this, simply tap the “Preview” button. If you’re happy with the result, tap “Apply” to save your new lock screen clock.\nConclusion\nChanging the lock screen clock on your Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is a simple process that can be done in just a few steps. With a wide range of clock styles and customization options to choose from, you can create a lock screen clock that reflects your personality and style. Try out different clock styles until you find one that you love, and don’t be afraid to experiment with different colors and fonts to make it your own.\nLike with any other Samsung device, the Galaxy Note 8 comes with so many features that first-time owners of the handset are likely going to feel overwhelmed. On the positive side, Samsung allows one to customise and tweak almost any part of the interface according to one’s liking which is usually appreciated by power users.\nHowever, one common question that I have frequently seen Galaxy Note 8 owners ask on online forums and technical experts is how to change the lock screen clock. Unlike other Android devices, the Galaxy Note 8 (and even the Galaxy S8/+) has two different lock screen clocks. The first one we are talking about here is the Always On Display which Samsung has enabled by default on the Galaxy S8 and even the Galaxy S8. As the name suggests, the feature takes advantage of the excellent OLED display on the handset to run in a low-power always-on state. In this mode, the display shows the time and date along with unread notification icons from selected apps. Samsung does offer a few different clock style for the Always-On display but does not allow one to use their own design or a custom background image. Here’s how you can customize the clock style of the Always On Display on the Galaxy Note 8: Step 1: Head over to Settings -\u003e Lock screen and Security -\u003e Always On Display. Step 2: You will find all the customization options related to the Always On Display here including the clock style. This includes being able to change the lock screen clock style to world clock or an analogue one or even switch to Edge clock. Additionally, you can also set the Always On Display to show a custom image or the calendar. Samsung will add more clock styles to the Always-On display on the Galaxy Note 8 and the Galaxy S8 with the upcoming Android 8.0 Oreo update for the devices. Do remember that using Always-On Display does have a noticeable impact on the battery life so if you usually away from the charger for long hours, it is recommended that you do not use this feature. Then, there is the actual lock screen clock — the good old one that we have gotten used to seeing on all smartphones nowadays. If this is the lock screen clock that you want to customise then sadly there’s not much you can do. While previous versions of Android featured lock screen widgets, it is not possible to add additional widgets on the Galaxy Note 8’s lock screen. Samsung has its own take on widgets which it is calling ‘Face widgets.’ One has to make do with the four widgets that Samsung has placed on the lock screen by default: clock, music, calendar, and alarm. By default, the lock screen will automatically switch to the clock widget and you will have to swipe to the left to access the other widgets. You can disable or re-order the ‘FaceWidgets’ from Settings -\u003e Lock screen and Security -\u003e FaceWidgets. If you are still not satisfied with the results, you can always try a third-party lock screen replacement app from the Play Store, though you will likely run into issues with them.\n","wordCount":"966","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-17T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-17T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Candice Mizutani"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://godekfredes.github.io/posts/how-to-change-lock-screen-clock-on-samsung-galaxy-note-81009564/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Godekfredes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://godekfredes.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Godekfredes (Alt + H)"><img src=https://godekfredes.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Godekfredes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unlock Hidden Customization: Learn How To Change Lock Screen Clock On Your Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Now!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-17 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 17, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;966 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Candice Mizutani</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>Unlock Hidden Customization: Learn How To Change Lock Screen Clock On Your Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Now!</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is a powerhouse of a phone, packed with advanced features and customization options.
