If you are tired of having a boring Instagram handle, then you’re not alone. Many people are looking for ways to change their username and make it more interesting. However, the process of changing your Instagram username isn’t as straightforward as you might think. In this article, we’ll explore a little-known trick that can help you change your username on Instagram with ease.\nAccording to Instagram’s policy, you can change your username only once every 14 days. This means that if you have recently changed your handle or decided to go with something else, you’ll have to wait two weeks before you can change it again. It can be frustrating, especially if you have a new idea in mind that you want to try out.\nBut what if we told you that there’s a way to circumvent this rule and change your handle more frequently? The secret lies in adding invisible characters to your username. These characters are not visible to the naked eye, but they can make your username unique, interesting, and most importantly, changeable.\nHere’s how you can do it:\nOpen any notes app on your phone or computer.\nType in the username you want to use, followed by a series of underscores or periods. For example: “myusername………………….” or “myusername______________”.\nCopy the entire username, including the underscores or periods.\nOpen Instagram, go to your profile page, and click on “Edit Profile”.\nPaste the username into the “Username” field.\nInstagram will give you a warning that the username is invalid, but you can choose to ignore it and click on “Done” anyway.\nCongratulations! You have now successfully changed your Instagram username. The best part is that you can repeat this process as many times as you like, as long as you add different numbers of underscores or periods each time.\nKeep in mind that adding too many underscores or periods can make your username look silly and unprofessional. It’s best to keep it simple and just add a few characters to make it unique. You can also use this trick to change the spacing or capitalization of your username, giving you even more options to play around with.\nIn conclusion, don’t settle for a boring Instagram username when you have the tools to make it unique and interesting. With this little-known trick, you can change your username as often as you like and keep your followers guessing. So go ahead and try it out – you might just be surprised at the results!\nAs the well-known social networking site of the social network giant Facebook, of course, I am talking about the Instagram simply offers through its official help website, the steps to modify both the username of our account and any other associated information. However, in case if you want to do so, then simply don’t worry about any complications, as in this guide, we will simply show you how to do it step by step and in all possible ways. So, now without wasting much time let’s get started and simply explore the whole tutorial that we have mentioned below.\nHow to change the Instagram username? The first method is from the phone Since the vast majority of Instagram users simply access the social network from their smartphones, hence, this is the first case that we will focus on. Hence, to change the username of Instagram from the Android or iOS app, you only have to access the profile’s edit menu and to do so simply follow these steps.\nFirst of all, simply open the application and go to your profile tab, located at the right side of the lower quick access bar. Now simply click on the button “Edit profile” located just below the information of followers and following. After the above step now simply in the “Username” section, enter the new name that you want to use. (Note: Keep in mind that it can not be a name that is already being used by another Instagram member.) Now simply click on the “Save” button in the upper right corner. That’s it, now you are done.\nThe second method is from the browser If you access Instagram from a computer through the web browser, then it is also possible to change your username, and the whole process is as simple as in the previous case, so, let’s get started.\nFirst of all, simply go to your profile by clicking on the icon located on the top right corner. Now simply click on the “Edit profile” button which is located next to your username. In the “Username” section, enter the new name that you want to use. (Note: Keep in mind that it can not be a name that is already being used by another Instagram member.) After the above step now simply go to the bottom of the page and click on “Send” to save the changes. That’s it, now you are done.\nSo, these are the two methods to change the Instagram username, both from the computer and from the mobile device. However, a fact is that when we change the user name, the old one simply gets released and will be available to any other member of the social network who wishes to use it. But, the well-known social networking site, of course, Instagram would be planning to introduce a solution with which they will prevent others from appropriating those that are temporarily free, as discovered by the well-known developer Jane Manchun Wong, who is an expert in reverse engineering. So, what do you think about this? Simply share all your views and thoughts in the comment section below. And if you liked this post then simply do not forget to share this tutorial with your friends and family.\n","wordCount":"971","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-19T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-19T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Marilyn Frantz"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://godekfredes.github.io/posts/how-to-change-your-instagram-username966725/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Godekfredes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://godekfredes.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Godekfredes (Alt + H)"><img src=https://godekfredes.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Godekfredes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Stop Settling for Boring Instagram Handles - Learn the Surprising Trick to Change Your Username Now!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-19 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 19, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;971 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Marilyn Frantz</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#how-to-change-the-instagram-username>How to change the Instagram username?</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=stop-settling-for-boring-instagram-handles---learn-the-surprising-trick-to-change-your-username-now>Stop Settling for Boring Instagram Handles - Learn the Surprising Trick to Change Your Username Now!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#stop-settling-for-boring-instagram-handles---learn-the-surprising-trick-to-change-your-username-now>#</a></h1><p>If you are tired of having a boring Instagram handle, then you&rsquo;re not alone.
