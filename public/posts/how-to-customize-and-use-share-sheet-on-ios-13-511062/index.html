Share Sheet has been a useful tool on iPhones for a while now, allowing users to share content between apps, but the new version has taken it to a whole new level. In this article, we’ll explore some of the killer tips and tricks that will help you unleash the power of Share Sheet and revolutionize your iPhone experience.\nTip #1: Customize Your Share Sheet\nOne of the new features of Share Sheet in iOS 13 is the ability to customize it. You can now rearrange your sharing options, including adding or removing apps that show up in the Share Sheet list. To do this, simply tap the ‘More’ button in the Share Sheet, then tap ‘Edit.’ This will allow you to rearrange and customize the order of your sharing options to your liking.\nTip #2: Pin Your Favorite Apps\nIf you use certain apps more frequently than others, you can pin them to the top of your Share Sheet for easy access. To do this, swipe left on the app you want to pin, then tap the ‘Pin’ button. Your pinned apps will now show up at the top of your Share Sheet list.\nTip #3: Share with Groups\nIf you frequently share content with the same group of people, you can create a sharing group to make the process easier. To do this, open the Messages app and start a new message. Tap the ‘Group’ button, then add the people you want to share with. Once you’ve created the group, you can quickly share content with them by selecting the group from your Share Sheet options.\nTip #4: Save to Files\nIf you’re someone who likes to save a lot of documents and files on your phone, you’ll love this new Share Sheet feature. You can now save files directly to your iCloud Drive or other cloud-based storage services from the Share Sheet. To do this, simply tap the ‘Save to Files’ option, then select the location where you want to save the file.\nTip #5: Use AirDrop\nAirDrop has been around for a while now, but it’s still one of the easiest and fastest ways to share content between iPhones. With the new Share Sheet, you can now quickly access AirDrop from anywhere on your phone. Simply tap the AirDrop icon in the Share Sheet, then select the device you want to share with.\nConclusion\nThe Share Sheet in iOS 13 has some amazing new features that can help you streamline your sharing process and make it easier than ever to share content between apps and devices. With these killer tips and tricks, you’ll be able to make the most of this powerful tool and revolutionize your iPhone experience.\nBefore jumping directly into the customization process, let’s first understand the new structure of the Share Sheet on iOS 13. A thing to note here is that, even though the structuring has changed and a few new options have been added, the functionality remains the same as the earlier versions.\niOS 13 Share Sheet Structure To break it down, the top of the Share Sheet shows the item you have selected to share, with an Options button at the bottom. Upon clicking this button, a list of options, depending on the item you are sharing, opens up, giving you the option to choose how you would like to share the selected item. So, for instance, if you want to share an image, you will see an option to include all image data, or say you want to share a web page, clicking on Options will show you different options like Save as: Automatic, PDF, and Web Archive, to select and share. Next, below the item you are sharing, the next row shows you contact-based sharing options, which can be either a person in your contact list or a person whom you recently contacted. Besides, if AirDrop is turned On on your device and there are nearby devices with discoverable AirDrop, the row also shows share suggestions for the same. Moving further, the third row on the sheet is where all the app-based sharing options reside. For the item you select to share, you will find different app suggestions to share the item with, in this row. Finally, the last row or the actions section on the Share Sheet is where a major rehaul can be noticed as you can now get a list of all the compatible actions that can be performed on the item you pick to share. Furthermore, the actions section is divided into three sections: favorites, app-specific actions, and other actions. Among these, the favorites section shows actions that you have performed the most, app-specific actions include actions for the app you are using to share the item, and other actions offer actions from other apps. So, for instance, if you choose a webpage to share, the action section will offer action suggestions like Markup, Print, Add Bookmark, and even the actions for the shortcuts that you have created using the Shortcuts app like Translate, Download Videos, Shorten URL, etc. Now that you are familiar with the structuring of the new Share Sheet on iOS 13, let’s move on to how you can customize it as per your requirements.\nHow to Customize Share Sheet on iOS 13 Customize App-based Sharing section Select an item in an app and tap the Share button.\nIn the third-row, swipe all the way to the left to see a button that says More. Tap on it.\nOn the next screen, hit Edit from the top-right corner.\nHere, tap the green (+) icon under Suggestions to add them to the Favorites list. Similarly, tap on the red (-) icon to remove an app from the Favorites list.\nToggle (On) the icon next to these apps to make them appear in the favorite app suggestions.\nArrange the order of apps in which they appear using the hamburger-style button on the right of the app.\nFinally, hit Done.\nCustomize Actions section Open an app, select an item, and hit the Share button.\nScroll down to the bottom and tap on Edit Actions….\nFrom the next screen, similar to how you added apps to the list, tap on the green (+) sign next to the suggested actions list to add them to the list of Favorite actions. Alternatively, you can also remove an action by tapping on the red (-) button.\nArrange the list of actions under Favorites using the hamburger-style button on the right of actions.\nHit Done.\nHow to Use Share Sheet on iOS 13 Once you have customized and personalized the Share Sheet as per your usage and needs, you can go ahead and start using it to share different items. Here’s how\nOpen an app and select an item that you want to share or make changes to. Once selected, click on the Share button and choose how you want to share it. Similarly, besides sharing an item, you can also perform certain actions on it by leveraging the Share utility. To break that down, you can either tap on the AirDrop icon — to share the item over AirDrop, or select any contact — to share it with them using the most frequently used app. On the other hand, you can perform an action on the selected item using the suggested options that appear in the actions section. That’s it for this article! Using this guide, you can now modify the Share Sheet on iOS 13 accordingly as and when required.\n","wordCount":"1298","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-04T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-04T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sherry Lopez"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://godekfredes.github.io/posts/how-to-customize-and-use-share-sheet-on-ios-13-511062/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Godekfredes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://godekfredes.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Godekfredes (Alt + H)"><img src=https://godekfredes.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Godekfredes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Revolutionize Your iPhone Experience: Unleash the Power of Share Sheet with These Killer Tips on iOS 13!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 4, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1298 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Sherry Lopez</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#ios-13-share-sheet-structure>iOS 13 Share Sheet Structure</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-customize-share-sheet-on-ios-13>How to Customize Share Sheet on iOS 13</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-use-share-sheet-on-ios-13>How to Use Share Sheet on iOS 13</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Revolutionize Your iPhone Experience: Unleash the Power of Share Sheet with These Killer Tips on iOS 13!</p><p>The iOS 13 update for iPhones comes with a lot of new features, but the one that&rsquo;s been making waves among tech enthusiasts is the revamped Share Sheet.
