With millions of reported cases worldwide, governments are urging people to stay indoors, practice social distancing, and wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus.\nWhile wearing masks and gloves is essential, the proper cleaning and maintenance of these protective gear items has become a matter of concern for many. Unfortunately, some people have resorted to microwaving their masks to disinfect them, which is not only ineffective but also potentially hazardous.\nIn this ultimate guide, we will discuss the proper ways to clean and maintain your clothes, gloves, and coronavirus masks to ensure your safety and well-being. You will learn tips and tricks to sanitize your protective gear without causing any damage and danger.\nThe Dos and Don’ts of Cleaning Clothes, Gloves and Coronavirus Masks:\nClothes: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends washing clothes regularly with soap and hot water to prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, not all clothes can withstand hot water, and some fabrics may shrink or lose their color if washed incorrectly.\nTo clean your clothes properly, read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions on the label. Use a washing machine and a detergent that is effective against viruses and bacteria. If you have COVID-19 symptoms or live with someone who does, wash your clothes separately, and avoid shaking them.\nGloves: Unlike masks that can be reused, gloves should not be used more than once to prevent cross-contamination. However, gloves can still trap and spread germs if not handled correctly.\nTo remove gloves safely, grab the cuff of one glove with the other hand and peel it off inside out. Hold the removed glove in the other hand and peel off the remaining glove. Discard the gloves in a bin, and wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\nCoronavirus Masks: Wearing masks has become a necessity in many countries, but the choice of the right mask and the proper cleaning of it are critical to stay safe.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cloth masks should be washed after each use and preferably in a washing machine. Avoid using bleach or fabric softeners, and tumble dry them on the highest temperature possible.\nN95 masks, on the other hand, should not be washed or reused due to their delicate filters. The CDC advises disposing of them after one use.\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, proper cleaning and maintenance of clothes, gloves, and coronavirus masks are essential to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Avoid microwaving your masks or using ineffective cleaning methods, and follow our guidelines for a safer and healthier you.\nBy staying informed and taking preventive measures, we can overcome this pandemic and emerge stronger and more resilient than ever.

Stay safe and stay healthy!\nUnfortunately, because this is an unprecedented situation, a lot of the information spreading online is untested, evolving or just plain wrong. What is accepted as fact one day is disregarded as baloney the next. Tap or click for some wacky 5G coronavirus conspiracy theories spreading across the web. One thing with many versions of the truth is how to disinfect packages, groceries and clothing. Here’s how we recommend you sanitize all your packages and deliveries, and now we’ll dive into proper disinfecting for clothing, gloves and masks. Here’s what you need to know.\nWhat’s the difference between cleaning and disinfecting? First, let’s get on the same page. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines cleaning as “the removal of germs, dirt and impurities from surfaces.” Cleaning doesn’t, by this definition, kill germs — but by removing them, it lowers the number of germs and the risk of spreading infection. VIDEO: Tap or click to discover three proven coronavirus prevention tips. Disinfecting “refers to using chemicals, for example, EPA-registered disinfectants, to kill germs on surfaces.” Killing germs on a surface after cleaning can lower the risk of spreading infection even more. When it comes to your belongings and coronavirus germs, we’re aiming for a combination of thorough cleaning and disinfecting. How does that work when it comes to fabrics?\nThe proper way to clean and disinfect clothes Turn to social media or do a quick search and you might think a microwave is the ideal way to disinfect items like a face mask. Not so fast. The truth is, certain materials can catch fire in microwaves — causing the end of your microwave or even your kitchen. This is especially true if you use a fabric mask supported with pieces of metal. Metal and microwaves don’t mix. To prevent you from burning down the house, we turned to the experts. We found washing and drying fabric items, including reusable (washable) gloves and masks, is sufficient for removing viruses. If you have someone infected with coronavirus in your household, you need to follow these steps:\nWear disposable gloves when handling that person’s dirty laundry. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with hot, soapy water after removing your gloves.If you don’t have or otherwise don’t wear protective gloves when touching the dirty laundry, hand washing is even more important.Avoid shaking dirty laundry to help minimize the chances of dispersing the virus through the air.You can wash dirty laundry from an ill household member with other people’s items.Launder items following the manufacturer’s instructions, using the warmest appropriate water setting when possible. Dry items completely.Clean and disinfect your laundry basket or hamper according to the CDC’s instructions for hard (non-porous) surfaces. If you can, use a disposable or washable liner in your hamper.\nNote: If you’re using reusable gloves, do not wear them for any household purpose other than cleaning and disinfecting surfaces for COVID-19. Now, the above precautions are vital if you have someone sick in your household. But what if you’re just worried about the germs you could pick up at the grocery store or running another essential errand? Use these same ideas to mitigate the risk.\nWash your clothes, masks, reusable gloves and any other fabric items using the hottest water setting you can. If you have a sanitize cycle, use it.Wash items you wore or used outside your house separately from the rest of your laundry. This includes fabric grocery totes.Dry your laundry thoroughly. If you have clothing you prefer not to put in the dryer, leave it in the closet for now and stick with fabric that can take the high heat of the dryer.Wipe down your laundry basket or hamper regularly with disinfecting wipes or paper towels moistened with 70% isopropyl alcohol, especially after you’ve been out.\nRefresher: How to disinfect packages and groceries Here’s our recommendation. For more details, tap or click here.\nKeep deliveries outside of your home for at least 24 hours. After you get a delivery, put on a pair of latex gloves (if you have them) and move your package to a secure spot outside. Throw away the gloves and wash your hands thoroughly.After a day, put on a fresh pair of gloves and wipe down the box or bag. Give the items in your box a wipedown, too. Throw out all the packaging, gloves and whatever you used to disinfect, then wash your hands again.\nThat covers non-perishables, but what about ordering food from a local restaurant? Tap or click here for our recommendations. You need to be careful getting groceries delivered, too. Tap or click here for the right steps to take. The key here? You have no idea who has touched your deliveries or the items inside. Err on the side of caution. A little extra work, like washing your hands more and proper disinfecting protocol, can help keep you and your loved ones healthy. Take care and stay safe.
