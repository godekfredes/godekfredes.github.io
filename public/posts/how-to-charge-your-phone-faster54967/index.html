From checking our emails to browsing the internet, we rely heavily on our phones. However, the one thing that can put a dent in our daily productivity is when our phones are low on battery. Charging our phones can take hours, which can be frustrating, especially when we’re in a hurry. But what if we told you that there are genius hacks that can speed up the charging process for your phone? Yes, you read that right! Read on to find out how you can unlock the secret to lightning-fast phone charging with these genius hacks.\nMethod 1: Use a Fast Charger Do you use the charger that came with your phone? If yes, then you might want to consider upgrading to a fast charger. Fast chargers are designed to charge your phone much faster than regular chargers. They deliver a higher amount of current to your phone, which allows it to charge at a faster rate. So, the next time you’re shopping for a charging cable or adapter, make sure you choose one that can support fast charging.\nMethod 2: Turn on Airplane Mode Did you know that your phone uses up a lot of battery power when it’s searching for a signal? That’s why turning on airplane mode can help speed up the charging process. When you turn on airplane mode, your phone will stop searching for a signal, which reduces the amount of power it uses. So, if you’re in a hurry and need to charge your phone faster, consider turning on airplane mode.\nMethod 3: Stop Using Your Phone This might seem like a no-brainer, but using your phone while it’s charging can slow down the charging process. This is because when you use your phone, it uses energy, which can counteract the charging process. So, if you want your phone to charge faster, then it’s best to stop using it altogether.\nMethod 4: Remove Your Phone Case Did you know that your phone case can affect the charging process? Some phone cases can trap heat, which can make your phone take longer to charge. So, if you want your phone to charge faster, then it’s best to remove the phone case before charging.\nMethod 5: Clean Your Charging Port Dirt and debris in your charging port can prevent your phone from charging properly. So, make sure you clean your charging port regularly to ensure that it’s free of dirt and debris. You can use a toothpick or a small brush to clean your charging port.\nConclusion: In conclusion, if you’re tired of waiting for hours for your phone to charge, then these genius hacks can help you speed up the charging process. By using a fast charger, turning on airplane mode, stopping using your phone, removing your phone case, and cleaning your charging port, you can unlock the secret to lightning-fast phone charging. So, try these hacks the next time you need to charge your phone, and see the difference for yourself!\nBattery life can vary widely depending on what you’re doing with your phone. You’ll go through your battery faster when you’re streaming video over the cellular network than if you’re just checking your messages here and there. Apple says its latest iPhones have the best battery life yet, but we’ll still find ways to drain them down. Fortunately, there are ways to make sure the recharging process is as efficient as possible. Follow these tips to get your iPhone juiced up and ready to run for hours.\nPut an iPad charger to work If you already have an iPad charger kicking around, you may be able to use it to charge your iPhone faster than with your smartphone’s standard charger. Apple says you can use 12W and 10W USB power adapters made for iPads and Mac notebooks with the iPhone 6 and up. If you’re not sure what adapter you have, take a look at the fine print on the back of it. Many recent iPad models have shipped with a 10W adapter, which should charge your phone faster than the lower-power 5W adapter that comes in the box with an iPhone.\nTurn your phone off (or use airplane mode) If time is of the essence, then shut your phone down while you’re charging it. This will help you resist the temptation to keep playing that game or streaming the latest show while you charge. Your iPhone will fill up faster if you abstain from using it. If you don’t want to shut it down all the way, then just switch it to airplane mode. Extend your phone’s battery life with these easy adjustments.\nChill it out The iPhone is designed to work best within reasonable operating temperatures and it will charge up most efficiently when it’s within that range. “Charging your device when it’s inside certain styles of cases may generate excess heat, which can affect battery capacity,” says Apple. The company advises removing your iPhone from its case if it seems to be getting hot while charging. This power bank will keep your gadgets charged through even the toughest weather conditions.\nFast-charge certain iPhones If you have an iPhone 8 or later, then you can take advantage of fast-charging technology. Apple says this can get your phone charged up to 50 percent in just 30 minutes, but you need to use the proper charging gear, and it comes at a price. You’ll need to have an USB-C to Lightning cable handy, for starters. Right now, only Apple offers an authorized version of this cable and it will cost you $19. Next, you’ll need a USB-C power brick. Naturally, Apple offers these, too, but you can also look to third-party USB-C chargers like the $30 Anker PowerPort II. All of this charging gear represents an added cost on top of what you’ve already paid for your phone. It could be worth it to you if you often find yourself in situations where your battery is dangerously low and you don’t have the luxury of extra time. But weigh that against just using a portable battery backup device.\nUpdate to the latest OS Apple has a history of working energy-saving upgrades into its operating system updates. So go ahead and make sure your iPhone is running the latest system so you can get the most time out of your phone between charges. If you own an iPhone XS or XS Max, there’s another compelling reason why you should stay on top of updates. Some users have reported issues with these new phones not charging properly when the screens are off. Apple’s iOS 12.1 update is already out in beta and the wide-release version is due this fall. The update should fix the XS charging issues. In the meantime, you can make sure the screen is on when you plug in to charge, or try unplugging the lightning cable and plugging it back in. Then, be sure to upgrade to 12.1 when it comes out.\n","wordCount":"1188","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-18T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Hanna Felix"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://godekfredes.github.io/posts/how-to-charge-your-phone-faster54967/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Godekfredes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://godekfredes.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Godekfredes (Alt + H)"><img src=https://godekfredes.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Godekfredes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unlock the Secret to Lightning-Fast Phone Charging with These Genius Hacks!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-18 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 18, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1188 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Hanna Felix</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#put-an-ipad-charger-to-work>Put an iPad charger to work</a></li><li><a href=#turn-your-phone-off-or-use-airplane-mode>Turn your phone off (or use airplane mode)</a></li><li><a href=#chill-it-out>Chill it out</a></li><li><a href=#fast-charge-certain-iphones>Fast-charge certain iPhones</a></li><li><a href=#update-to-the-latest-os>Update to the latest OS</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>title: Unlock the Secret to Lightning-Fast Phone Charging with These Genius Hacks!</p><p>Introduction:
