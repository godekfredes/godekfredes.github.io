Well, you are not alone. Many people want to be able to read their messages without appearing online or without letting others know that they have read the messages. Fortunately, there are ways to sneakily read Facebook and WhatsApp messages without letting your friends know, and we are here to share them with you!\nFacebook Messenger Secrets\nThe Facebook Messenger app has a feature that allows you to read messages without alerting the sender that you have read their message. To turn on this feature, follow the steps below:\nStep 1: Open the Facebook Messenger app on your device.\nStep 2: Tap on your profile picture at the top left corner of the screen.\nStep 3: Tap on the “Active Status” option.\nStep 4: Toggle off the switch next to “Show when you’re active.”\nOnce you have turned off your active status, you can now read your Facebook messages without your friends knowing that you are online. However, keep in mind that this feature will also prevent you from seeing when your friends are online.\nWhatsApp Secrets\nWhatsApp is another messaging app where you can read messages sneakily without letting your friends know. Here are some tricks you can try:\nDisable Read Receipts The Read Receipts feature shows blue ticks when the receiver has read your message. To disable this feature, follow the steps below:\nStep 1: Open WhatsApp on your device.\nStep 2: Tap on the three-dot menu at the top right corner of the screen.\nStep 3: Select “Settings” from the drop-down menu.\nStep 4: Tap on “Account.”\nStep 5: Tap on “Privacy.”\nStep 6: Toggle off the switch next to “Read receipts.”\nOnce you have turned off the Read Receipts feature, you can read your WhatsApp messages without the sender knowing that you have read them. However, keep in mind that you won’t be able to see when your friends have read your messages either.\nUse WhatsApp Web WhatsApp Web is a desktop version of WhatsApp that you can use on your computer. This feature allows you to read your WhatsApp messages without appearing online on your mobile device. Here’s how to use WhatsApp Web:\nStep 1: Open WhatsApp on your mobile device.\nStep 2: Tap on the three-dot menu at the top right corner of the screen.\nStep 3: Select “WhatsApp Web” from the drop-down menu.\nStep 4: Open a web browser on your computer and go to the WhatsApp Web website.\nStep 5: Scan the QR code on the website using your mobile device.\nStep 6: You can now read your WhatsApp messages on your computer without letting your friends know that you are online.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, there are ways to read your Facebook and WhatsApp messages without letting your friends know. By using the tricks and tips we’ve provided, you can read your messages secretly and avoid any awkward situations that may arise. However, always remember to respect your friends’ privacy and avoid using these features to spy on others. Use these tips for your personal comfort and well-being.\nCheck Facebook and WhatsApp Messages Without Updating the Read Receipts on Android On Android, you will have to install an app called “Unseen,” which lets you get around the “Seen” check marks for a slew of messaging apps. This includes Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Viber. Unseen functions by simply replicating and logging your incoming notifications separately. Hence, for every incoming text, you’ll receive two alerts — one from the official app itself and another from Unseen. If you view the message on Unseen, the read receipts won’t be updated. The app works quite seamlessly, although since it employs the notification system for this, you won’t be able to check any sort of media on Unseen unless you enable the auto download. The app also comes with an “All Messages” tab which, as you’d expect, lets you read all the unread chats in one place. From there, if you’d like to reply, Unseen will redirect to the original app. The free version of Unseen contains advertisement banners on the bottom. For Rs 70, however, you can get rid of them. You can download Unseen from this link. There’s another workaround for WhatsApp you should probably know as well. The messaging app has a widget on Android which you can simply place on the home screen and read the incoming messages without messing with the receipts. This also eliminates the need for an extra application, but unfortunately, others like Facebook Messenger don’t have a similar widget.\nCheck Facebook Messages Without Updating the Read Receipts on iOS On iOS, your options are significantly limited. For starters, there’s no way to avoid reading receipts on WhatsApp. There is, fortunately, an app called NoSeen that allows you to read Facebook chats without letting the other person know. Once logged in, NoSeen lets you check all your recent messages and bypasses read receipts in the process. The chats you view on NoSeen remain unread until you open them on the official Facebook apps like Messenger or its desktop counterparts. Sadly, as of now, NoSeen doesn’t support media or even stickers and only functions with texts. As a placeholder for such messages, the app adds an entry that says, “We will support viewing stickers, media, and files very soon.” There’s also an option if you’d like to reply to messages, although that merely takes you to Facebook Messenger. Apart from that, NoSeen lacks any further customization options and is quite barebones in that regard. It is entirely free of cost, without any in-app purchases and advertisements whatsoever.
