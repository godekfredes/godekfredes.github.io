Outdated antivirus software is vulnerable to cyber-attacks that have been fixed in newer versions.\nRun a vulnerability scanner: Several vendors offer vulnerability scanners that look for vulnerabilities or gaps in your PC that could be exploited.\nShare Data with an antivirus company only over a secure connection: Before sharing any data, make sure you are connected to a secure network, and consider encrypting the data to prevent tampering.\nConclusion: The truth is that antivirus software is designed to protect users, but it’s not perfect, and often, flaws can create vulnerability in your system. Regular updates and patching your software can reduce the risk of attack. Still, it is essential to remain vigilant, and regularly check your software for potential security holes. Implementing basic cyber hygiene, such as strong passwords, avoiding unsecured networks, and using a VPN, can reduce your risk of malware and keep your system secure. Ultimately, cybersecurity is a team effort, and by taking steps to protect yourself you and the larger digital community become less vulnerable to cyber threats.\nToday you must be using Antivirus in computers and laptops.
