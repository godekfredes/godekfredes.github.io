Also: The best extreme weather tech And this is just the beginning, with temperatures in affected areas dropping 30 to 50 degrees below normal in the coming days. Winter is coming. Whether you’re someone who hunkers down when the weather gets bad, or you have to be out and about, technology can make a difference. And while most of the time that difference is reducing a problem into an inconvenience, sometimes – and I don’t want to sound overly dramatic saying this – it can be the difference between life and death.
