Your contact list holds your clients, customers, partners, and prospects, useful resources that help you to drive your business goals. However, it is not enough to have a large contact list. You also need to ensure that your contact list is tidy and up-to-date.\nA dirty contact list is a common problem that several businesses face. It could contain outdated contacts or duplicates, and irrelevant contacts that don’t offer any value to your business. Bouncing back emails, missed opportunities, and losing potential clients are some of the typical consequences of a dirty contact list.\nHowever, you can avoid these excruciating experiences by following this genius trick to clean up your contact list:\nStep 1: Sort your contact list\nThe first thing you want to do is to sort your contact list. You can do this by sorting your contacts according to different categories such as active contacts, inactive contacts, leads, clients, and prospects. Categorizing your contact list will help you to target effectively and engage with them better in the future.\nStep 2: Remove duplicates\nThe second step is to remove duplicate contacts. When organizing your contact list, duplicates can be an inconvenience. It reduces the accuracy of information, takes up more space, and makes your list look disorganized. One way to remove duplicates is by using an email marketing software that has the capability to remove duplicates.\nStep 3: Filter your list\nThe third thing you want to do is filter your list. Filtering your list involves removing or deleting invalid email addresses, bounced emails, inactive contacts, and irrelevant contacts. An email marketing software can also do this automatically by identifying spam traps, invalid email addresses, and cleaning up your list for you.\nStep 4: Update your contacts\nFinally, update your contacts. Updating your contacts requires an extra step of effort, but it’s important to do. A few ways you can update your contacts is by asking them to confirm their contact information or offering opt-in forms to collect updated email addresses. Remember, the more accurate your contact list is, the more successful your email campaigns and other targeted marketing efforts will be in the future.\nIn conclusion, taking time to clean up your contact list is not the most exciting task, but it’s a critical one that can impact your business success. A clean list of contacts will enable you to communicate and engage most effectively with your customers and prospects, reduce bounced emails, and bounce rates, and ultimately drive more business results. Use this genius trick to revamp your business game, and watch as your contact list works wonders for you.\nYour Contacts app may be stuffed to the gills with names, phone numbers, and email addresses, but it doesn’t have to stay that way. A lot of those contacts should be current and relevant, but you probably also have some duplicates or multiple entries for the same person. You likely also have some outdated contacts you no longer need. It’s time to take some steps to clean up your address book. Trying to tackle it one by one could be absolutely maddening, but there are some apps and helpful tricks that make the process a lot less painful. Here’s how to do it.\nUn-sync contacts for certain accounts You may have more accounts than you realize sharing information with your iPhone Contacts app. To see what’s up, head into Settings and choose Passwords \u0026 Accounts. You will see a list of accounts, which could include Gmail or other email accounts. If you want to keep your iPhone stocked with just your phone contacts, you can choose to turn off Contacts syncing with your email accounts. Just tap on the name of the account and turn off the Contacts slider. You will get a warning that this will remove those contacts from your device. But don’t worry, they won’t be deleted from the account itself. This move can be a quick way to reduce your Contacts list to a more manageable level. Apple’s iOS 12 is here. Learn what you do now that you couldn’t do before.\nMerge duplicate contacts Duplicate entries are a common complaint when it comes to contacts. For a tidier address book, you want to merge these together into one entry per person. For this task, check out an app like Smart Merge Pro, which you can download for free. The app will check your contacts, look for duplicates, and give you the opportunity to merge those extraneous entries together. Just be sure to backup your contacts when Smart Merge Pro gives you the opportunity.\nDelete contacts manually You can still delete contacts one by one as you go along. Just tap on the contact, tap on Edit, and scroll down until you see the Delete Contact option. You will need to tap again on the little pop-up window to confirm the removal. This is a simple option for spot-cleaning your address book here and thereafter you’ve merged duplicates and disabled unneeded account synchronizations. Here’s how to free up storage on your iPhone.\nUse an address book manager One way to really get a handle on your contacts is to draft an address book manager app into service. These apps handle the heavy lifting of tracking, organizing, and updating your contacts.\nCircleBack The CircleBack app promises to bring a better address book to your iPhone. One of the free app’s most enticing features is its ability to seek out contact information lurking in email signatures and turn it into usable contacts. If you still find yourself wrangling a lot of physical business cards, then you will appreciate its ability to scan cards using your iPhone’s camera and add them to your address book. CircleBack is also constantly on the lookout for changes in your contacts, so it can update them and keep the information fresh. A built-in contact de-duplication feature also helps keep down the contact clutter. Give this app a try if you want a free way to maintain a more advanced address book.\nCloze Relationship Management The Cloze app is much more than just a way to wrangle your contacts. It behaves like a personal assistant by learning which contacts are important to you. It tracks your interactions and can update contacts based on changes in their email signatures. The app can also remind you to get in touch with people you haven’t been in communication with in a while. The basic Cloze app is free, but to access its most powerful features you’ll need a subscription that starts at $13.33 per month. The subscription price should tip you off that this app is aimed at business professionals who need to keep track of clients and other people in their business networks. If that sounds like you, then you may find the cost well worth it. Whether you simply clean up your existing iPhone contacts or choose to use a different app entirely, you will be rewarded with a less cluttered and easier-to-navigate address book.\n","wordCount":"1201","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-20T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Greg Turner"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://godekfredes.github.io/posts/how-to-clean-up-your-contact-list394387/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Godekfredes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://godekfredes.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Godekfredes (Alt + H)"><img src=https://godekfredes.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Godekfredes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Revamp Your Business Game with This Genius Trick to Clean Up Your Contact List!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 20, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1201 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Greg Turner</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#un-sync-contacts-for-certain-accounts>Un-sync contacts for certain accounts</a></li><li><a href=#merge-duplicate-contacts>Merge duplicate contacts</a></li><li><a href=#delete-contacts-manually>Delete contacts manually</a></li><li><a href=#use-an-address-book-manager>Use an address book manager</a><ul><li></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Revamp Your Business Game with This Genius Trick to Clean Up Your Contact List!</p><p>As a business owner or marketer, one of the most crucial aspects that you need to have in mind is your contact list.
