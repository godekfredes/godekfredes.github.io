Read on!\nMethod 1: Using an Alternate Email Address One of the easiest ways to create a Gmail account without sharing your phone number is by using an alternative email address. Follow the steps below to create your account:\nGo to the Gmail Sign-up page. Fill in your desired username and password. Instead of filling in your phone number in the ‘phone number’ field, go to the ‘email address’ field. Enter your alternate email address in the field. Complete the rest of the registration process by clicking ‘Next’. This method is simple, and it allows you to create a Gmail account without giving out your phone number.\nMethod 2: Use a Temporary Phone Number If you do not have an alternate email address, you can use a temporary phone number. Many websites offer temporary phone numbers for free or for a minimal fee. Follow the steps below to create your Gmail account with a temporary phone number:\nGo to the Gmail Sign-up page. Fill in your desired username and password. Go to the ‘phone number’ field. Use a temporary phone number in the field. Complete the rest of the registration process by clicking ‘Next.’ Using a temporary phone number is an excellent option, especially if you do not want to share your phone number. However, you should ensure that the website offering the temporary phone numbers is reliable and secure.\nMethod 3: Use a Google Voice Number If you do not want to use an alternate email address or a temporary phone number, you can use a Google Voice number. A Google Voice number is a phone number that you can use to make and receive calls, send text messages, and use voicemail. To create a Gmail account with a Google Voice number, follow the steps below:\nGo to the Google Voice website and sign up. Choose a phone number that suits you. Go to the Gmail Sign-up page. Fill in your desired username and password. Use the Google Voice number in the ‘phone number’ field. Complete the rest of the registration process by clicking ‘Next.’ Using a Google Voice number is an excellent option if you want to create a Gmail account without sharing your original phone number.

Now open the URL https://accounts.google.com/SignUp. You will see it will open a Google account registration page where you must fill in all the details of the account you want to create. 3. Now, you will see that there will be an option for a phone number, do not enter the phone number and click on the create account button. That’s it!
