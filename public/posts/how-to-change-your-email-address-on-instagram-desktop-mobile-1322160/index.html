Maybe it’s a work email that you no longer use or a personal email that’s just too embarrassing to associate with your carefully curated Instagram profile. Whatever the reason, it’s frustrating to have an old email address linked to your social media presence. But don’t worry - there is a way to fix it!\nIntroducing: the Email Swap Trick. This simple trick allows you to change the email address associated with your Instagram account without having to create a new account or lose any of your existing content or followers. Here’s how to do it:\nStep 1: Create a new email address First, you’ll need to create a new email address that you’d like to associate with your Instagram account. This should be an email address that you plan to use for the foreseeable future, as you can only change your email address once every two weeks.\nStep 2: Add your new email address to your Instagram account Once you have your new email address, go to your Instagram profile and tap on the “Edit Profile” button. From there, scroll down to the “Private Information” section and tap on “Email.” Replace your old email address with your new one, and save your changes.\nStep 3: Verify your new email address After you’ve swapped out your old email address for your new one, Instagram will send a verification email to your new address. Check your inbox, open the email from Instagram, and click on the verification link. This will confirm that your new email address is valid and associated with your Instagram account.\nStep 4: Remove your old email address Once your new email address is verified, you can safely remove your old email address from your Instagram account. To do this, go back to the “Edit Profile” section and click on the “x” next to your old email address. This will remove it from your account, and from now on, you’ll only receive notifications and updates from Instagram at your new email address.\nAnd that’s it! The Email Swap Trick is a simple, easy way to revamp your Instagram game and get rid of any old email addresses that you’d rather not associate with your account. By following these four steps, you can make sure that your Instagram profile is always up-to-date and in line with your personal or professional brand. So what are you waiting for? Give it a try!\nInstagram now allows you to exchange text messages, make voice \u0026 video calls, and more. If you remember, while creating an Instagram account, you were asked to enter your personal information such as email address, phone number, and more. Yes, you can sign up with your phone number, but most people sign up using their email addresses. If you created an Instagram account with an email address, but somehow lost access to your email, you can easily update a new one on your Instagram account.\nSteps to Change Your Email Address on Instagram (Desktop \u0026 Mobile) So, if you are looking for ways to change your Email address on Instagram, you are reading the right guide.
