Do you want peace of mind while they are at home or out and about? It is essential to explore the benefits of medical alert systems. They can provide your loved one with the assistance they need in case of an emergency. Here’s the ultimate guide to choosing the right medical alert system.\nWhat is a Medical Alert System?\nA medical alert system is a device that helps seniors, disabled individuals, and those with health issues stay safe and secure in case of an emergency. The device connects to a communication center, which dispatches emergency services when needed. There are two types of medical alert systems, traditional and mobile.\nTraditional medical alert systems comprise of a base station and a pendant or wristband. They usually work within a specific range and connect to a landline. Mobile medical alert systems are more advanced and use cellular networks to connect the user to the call center. They come with GPS tracking features, making it easier for emergency services to locate the person in need.\nChoosing The Right Medical Alert System\nEvaluate Your Loved One’s Needs Before choosing a medical alert system, consider your loved one’s needs. Do they need a system that tracks their location, or are they only concerned with getting help in case of an emergency? Do they prefer a traditional or mobile system?\nLook For A Reliable Company Look for a company that has a reputation for providing quality services. Read reviews and check for certifications, such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL) certification, which ensures that the device is reliable.\nConsider The Cost Cost is a critical factor in choosing a medical alert system. Traditional systems are often less expensive than mobile systems. However, mobile systems are more convenient as they provide more features such as GPS tracking.\nUnderstand The Features Medical alert systems come with different features. Some have automatic fall detection, while others require manual activation. Some come with additional services, such as medication reminders or caregiver check-ins.\nTest The Device Before purchasing a medical alert system, test it to ensure that it works for your loved one. Check the range and battery life, and ensure that the call center provides quality services.\nConclusion\nChoosing the right medical alert system is crucial for the safety and security of your loved one. Evaluate your loved one’s needs, look for a reliable company, consider the cost and understand the features before purchasing a device. With the right medical alert system, you can have peace of mind knowing that your loved one is safe and secure in case of an emergency.\nAccording to NCOA, an older adult is treated in the emergency room for a fall every 11 seconds. Every 19 minutes, an older adult dies from a fall. Falls are the leading cause of fatal injury among older adults as well. The best way to handle that concern is to help your loved one find a balance between independence and safety. A medical alert system will help. And it will give you the peace of mind you need. So, if you’re concerned about an aging loved one, it’s time to invest in this type of system. Here’s why.\nMedical alert systems: What they are and how they work If you have a loved one who’s getting older, you may be looking for a way to help them maintain their independence while ensuring they’re safe. That can be tough to do, but a medical alert system can help. You know those old, “Help! I’ve fallen, and I can’t get up!” commercials? They were advertising a medical alert system. They’re systems that monitor your loved one while at home or out and about. If a medical emergency triggers the system, it’s used to summon help via operators on the other end, who can call either an ambulance or a loved one. A medical alert system will most of the time consist of a wearable pendant and a base station that connects to a phone line. The pendant is pressed if there’s an emergency or a fall and your loved one needs help. Calls to monitoring agents are placed through the connected phone line. These systems can also be used to monitor for falls or other accidents. Most systems offer additional fall detection and GPS tracking on top of basic services to ensure your loved one is covered no matter where they are. You aren’t limited to just a pendant system, either; there are tons of different options out there. Some offer mobile device integration or even smartwatches that can help keep your loved one safe. Newer devices may even be able to monitor your loved one’s vitals and call for help if there’s a health emergency on the horizon. But with so many options, how can you choose? We’re breaking it down for you below.\nLife Alert Life Alert is one of the most popular medical alert systems on the market, and so is the trusted service you’ll get with it.

That’s important to keep in mind if you’re concerned about those types of accidents.\nActivation fee: $0 to $95Monthly costs: $49 for in-home landline service; $49 for in-home cellular service; $19 for mobile GPS trackingFall detection: Not offeredContract required: Yes, 36 months.
