With the rise in cyber-attacks, protecting our online identity with strong passwords is critical. According to cybersecurity experts, the most common cause of a data breach is weak passwords. Therefore, it is essential to create strong passwords that are difficult for hackers to crack.\nMany people struggle to create strong passwords that are easily memorable, while others use the same password for every account, which puts all their online information at risk of getting hacked. If you have been struggling to come up with a strong password, you need to learn the insanely effective tips to create the ultimate password with Komando Com.\nHere are some of the tips:\nUse A Passphrase: Instead of using a single word, use a passphrase, which is a group of random words strung together with spaces. Long passphrases are more challenging to crack, and they are easier to remember than random letters, numbers, and symbols. You can use a memorable paragraph or sentence that has meaning to you, but which others would not predict.\nMix Characters: A strong password should include a mix of characters such as lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols such as, !, @, #, $, and %. Avoid using common words and letters that follow a sequence on the keyboard, such as qwerty or 123456, as they are easily guessable.\nAvoid Personal Information: Avoid using personal information such as your name, date of birth or social security number, as they are easy to guess. The same goes for the names of your pets, places you lived, or your favorite sports team, as they can be easily researched.\nKeep It Simple: While it is important to create a unique password, it is equally important to remember it. Therefore, aim for simplicity without sacrificing complexity. Keep your passphrase or password at least eight characters long without including spaces.\nRegularly update: Updating your password regularly can help you stay one step ahead of hackers. We recommend updating your password at least every three to six months to ensure your online information remains secure.\nMost importantly, ensure that you do not use the same password for multiple accounts. While it may seem convenient, it puts all your online information in jeopardy.\nKomando Com is a website that offers practical tips on how to keep your online identity safe. They offer advanced password manager tools that generate secure and unique passwords for each account you have. The tools allow you to store passwords safely and access them from any device without having to remember each password.\nIn conclusion, creating strong passwords is not rocket science, and with a few simple tips, you can protect your online data from hackers. By using a passphrase, adding complexity, avoiding personal information, and frequently updating your password, you can ensure your online identity is secure. In addition, tools like Komando Com can help you generate strong and unique passwords to keep hackers at bay. Remember to keep yourself safe and secure by implementing proper password and security measures.\nCreating and remembering hard-to-guess passwords is a lot easier than you may think. So, let’s get started with simple how-to steps to create super-secure passwords.\n1. Password generator If you’re like most people, your Internet passwords are along the lines of your birthday or kids’ birthdays. Or, if you get really creative in keeping hackers away from your private information, maybe it’s your mother’s maiden name. Of course, you start running into all sorts of troubles when your password requires a combination of letters, numbers and symbols. These days, a lot of passwords require that you also use some upper- and lower-case letters, too. Do you have time to create all those crazy combinations? No, no one does. Here’s a much easier solution. Try a FREE password generator like Random Password Generator. (See photos below.) You input the type of characters and number of characters that you need and it quickly creates an extremely complicated password for you. Don’t panic! You don’t have to remember this super-complicated password. Random Password Generator automatically saves your passwords in its Password Manager. (Note: Be sure to put a description next to each password, so you know which online account it’s for.)\n2. Hard-to-guess passwords You may have the wrong impression about hackers. If you envision a long-haired teenager in his parents’ basement typing in different guesses for your passwords, that’s rarely how it’s done. Instead, think about hackers the way they operate these days. There could be dozens of them sitting in an office building in Eastern Europe working 9-to-5 trying to hack into computer systems and, ultimately, take over your computer and demand ransom to give it back. Or they just flip your logins and passwords on the Black Market for a quick profit. They have sophisticated computer systems to help them scan through hundreds or thousands of passwords in no time. As you can imagine, these computer systems are really good at guessing passwords. Don’t make it easier for them to steal your personal information. If your password has more than eight characters in it, and you mix up letters, numbers and symbols, they may not even bother trying to guess it. They’ll just move on to the millions of people using “123456” or “password.”\n3. Passphrase Have you noticed a theme yet? When it comes to passwords, make it tough for hackers and organized cyber crime rings to guess yours. You may want to try a passphrase. When it comes to super-long passwords, the good news is it could take hackers years to guess yours if it has 15 or so characters. The bad news is, a password that long is really easy to forget. So, try a phrase you’ll remember. How about, “MysonwasbornonAug12!” Who’s going to guess that? You’ve got caps, lower-case letters, numbers and a symbol.\n","wordCount":"1011","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-20T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sarah Schuster"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://godekfredes.github.io/posts/how-to-create-the-perfect-password-komando-com128576/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Godekfredes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://godekfredes.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Godekfredes (Alt + H)"><img src=https://godekfredes.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Godekfredes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Stop Hackers In Their Tracks: Learn the Insanely Effective Tips to Create the Ultimate Password with Komando Com!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 20, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1011 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Sarah Schuster</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-password-generator>1.
