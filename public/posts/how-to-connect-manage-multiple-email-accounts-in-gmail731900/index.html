Are you tired of managing multiple email accounts separately? Do you have multiple email accounts that you use for work, personal use, or for various subscriptions? It can be exhausting and frustrating to constantly switch back and forth between various email accounts just to stay on top of your inbox.\nThe good news is that Gmail has a powerful multi-tasking superpower that most people are overlooking - the ability to connect and manage multiple email accounts with ease! In this article, we will show you how you can unlock this hidden feature and simplify your email management process.\nStep 1: Add your additional email accounts in Gmail The first step to managing multiple email accounts in Gmail is to add accounts you want to manage. Here’s how you can do it:\nOpen your Gmail account and click on the gear icon in the top right corner. From the dropdown menu, click on “Settings.” Go to the “Accounts and Import” tab and scroll down to the “Check mail from other accounts” section. Click on the “Add a mail account” button. Enter the email address of the account you want to add and click on “Next.” Follow the prompts to enter your username, password, and server information. You can choose whether to import emails from this account immediately or start importing later. Step 2: Set up your email accounts to send and receive emails Once you’ve added your additional email accounts to Gmail, the next step is to set them up to send and receive emails. Here’s how you can do it:\nGo to the “Accounts and Import” tab in settings. Under the “Send mail as” section, click on “Add another email address.” Enter the email address you want to use and click on “Next.” Follow the prompts to enter your name and email address. You will receive a verification email that you need to confirm to finish the process. Now that you’ve added your email accounts and set them up to send and receive emails, let’s look at how you can manage them efficiently.\nStep 3: Use labels to manage your emails One of the best ways to manage multiple email accounts in Gmail is to use labels. Labels are like folders that help you organize your emails based on specific criteria, such as the sender, subject, or content. Here’s how you can create and use labels.\nInside your inbox, click on the small grey arrow at the right of the search bar to open the search options pop-up box. Choose which label you would like to add in the “has the words” box, then click on “Create filter with this search.” In the next window, you can choose to add specific actions for this filter like apply a label or delete it. For any label you would like to quickly access, click to place a right mouse-click on the label in the left menu, and select “Add to Favorites.” Step 4: Use keyboard shortcuts Another great way to manage multiple email accounts with ease is to use keyboard shortcuts. Keyboard shortcuts are a fast and efficient way to navigate your Gmail account, allowing you to perform various actions without having to click on multiple links. Here are the most used ones.\nTo compose a new email use “C.” To move to the next message use “J.” To move to the previous message use “K.” To reply to an email, use “R.” To forward an email, use “F.” To select all emails on your screen, use “” if you would like to deselect them all that way, use the same “” key again to deselect all emails. By using these keyboard shortcuts with labels, you can quickly sort through emails and keep them in their respective folders.\nIn conclusion, managing multiple email accounts can be difficult, but with Gmail’s multi-tasking superpower, it can be both easy and efficient, especially once you have set your labels and keyboard shortcuts. By following the steps we’ve outlined above, you can easily manage all of your email accounts within your Gmail account, save yourself time and effort, and never miss an important message again!\nAlmost every professionals and business profiles now rely on Gmail to connect with their customers.
