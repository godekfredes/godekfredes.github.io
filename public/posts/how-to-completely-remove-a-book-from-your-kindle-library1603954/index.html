Learn How to Exorcise Them Completely from Your Library!\nAre you haunted by the thought of ghost books lurking on your Kindle? Have you ever noticed books that you didn’t download or purchase, but they somehow found their way into your library? This phenomenon is known as phantom or ghost books, and many Kindle users have experienced it.\nIt’s not uncommon for ghost books to appear on your Kindle, especially if you’ve been using it for a long time or borrowed someone else’s device. Ghost books, in most cases, are nothing more than mere glitches in the system, and they don’t pose any direct threat to your Kindle, but they can be pretty annoying, and they’re taking up space in your library. So, how do you get rid of them?\nHere are some simple steps to exorcise ghost books completely from your Kindle:\nIdentify the Ghosts The first step is to identify the ghost books. Go to your Kindle library and look for books that don’t belong to you or any of the devices connected to your account. To check who purchased the book, click on the title and scroll down to the “Product Details” section. If the book isn’t listed under your account or any of your family members’ shared libraries, it’s most likely a ghost book.\nUnregister and Re-register Your Kindle One of the most effective ways to exorcise ghost books is to unregister and re-register your Kindle. This process resets your Kindle, erasing all the data and settings, and reinstalls the latest version of the software. To do this, go to “Menu,” select “Settings,” and choose “Deregister Device.” Confirm your decision by selecting “Deregister” once more. After that, register your Kindle again by entering your Amazon account credentials.\nDelete the Ghosts Once your Kindle has been reset, the ghost books should have disappeared. However, if some still remain, you can delete them manually. To do this, go to your Kindle library and locate the ghost book. Press and hold the title until a menu pops up, then choose “Remove from Device.” The book will still be stored in your Amazon cloud, but it won’t occupy space on your Kindle anymore.\nCheck Your Account for Unauthorized Purchases In rare cases, ghost books could be a result of unauthorized purchases made on your Amazon account. To rule out this possibility, log in to your Amazon account and go to “Your Orders.” Look for any books you didn’t purchase and take the necessary actions to resolve the issue.\nIn conclusion, experiencing ghost books on your Kindle is a common issue that many users face. But don’t let them scare you! By following these simple steps, you can exorcise them completely from your library, freeing up space for the books you actually want to read.\nHowever, the problem that Kindle users often face is their Kindle Library fills up very fast. If you often add new books, clearing out the old titles is recommended to make room for the new ones.\nCompletely Remove A Book from Your Kindle Library So, in this article, we will share a step-by-step guide on removing a book from your Kindle library. The steps will be very easy; follow them as mentioned below.\nDelete Books from your Kindle Using Your Device If you are using a Kindle device, you must follow these steps to delete a book from your Kindle library.\nFirst, open your Kindle device and navigate your library. Now press and hold on to the cover of the book you want to remove. From the list of options, tap on Remove from device. That’s it! This will remove the book from your Kindle device. You must also follow the same steps on the Android and iOS Kindle apps. Remove Books from Kindle using a PC You can also use your computer to delete books from your Kindle.
