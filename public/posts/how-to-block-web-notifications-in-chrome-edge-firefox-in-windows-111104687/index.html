Web notifications are an important part of modern browsing experience. They help you stay updated with the latest developments and offers from websites that you visit. However, they can also be very annoying when they pop-up continuously, distracting you from your work. If you are a Windows 11 user and you are struggling to get rid of these notifications, there is a simple trick that you can use to stop them completely. In this article, we will reveal the secret trick to stop annoying web notifications in Windows 11.\nUnderstanding Web Notifications Web notifications are pop-ups generated by websites that you visit. They are meant to inform you about updates, promotions, and other events related to the site. When you allow a site to show notifications, you will receive pop-ups that contain a message, a graphic, or a sound. Depending on the browser settings, you may receive web notifications on your desktop, your phone, or your tablet.\nWhile web notifications may be useful in certain situations, they can become very annoying when they keep popping up even when you are not interested in them. For example, you may have subscribed to a site for a free trial or a special offer, but later realized that you are not interested in their services. However, the notifications keep coming, interrupting your work and disturbing your peace.\nThe Problem with Windows 11 In Windows 11, web notifications are managed by the Action Center. This is a place where you can see all your notifications in one place, from both your system and your apps. When a website sends you a notification, it will appear in the Action Center, and you can either click on it to view it or dismiss it to remove it from the list.\nHowever, the problem with Windows 11 is that it does not provide an easy way to stop web notifications from a particular site. Even if you dismiss a notification from a site, you will keep receiving notifications from that same site in the future. This is because the browser settings that control notifications are managed separately from Windows.\nThe Secret Trick to Stop Web Notifications in Windows 11 To stop annoying web notifications in Windows 11, you need to go to your browser settings and disable notifications from the sites that are bothering you. Here are the steps to follow:\nOpen your browser and go to the Settings menu Look for the section that controls Notifications or Alerts Find the option that allows you to block notifications from specific sites Enter the site URL that you want to block and save the changes Once you have blocked notifications from a site in your browser settings, you will no longer receive notifications from that site on your Windows 11 device. This trick works for all major browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.\nConclusion Web notifications can be both helpful and annoying depending on your needs and preferences. In Windows 11, it can be challenging to stop web notifications from specific sites as they keep popping up even after you dismiss them. However, by using the simple trick outlined in this article, you can stop web notifications from a particular site completely.
