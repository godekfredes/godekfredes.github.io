Did you know that changing the Mac address of your Android device could help protect your privacy and increase security? Surprised? Don’t be. In this article, we will reveal the secret trick to change the Mac address of your Android device - and it’s easier than you might think!\nFirst, let’s start with the basics. What is a Mac address? A Mac address, or Media Access Control address, is a unique identifier assigned to every network device. It is used to identify devices in a network and allow them to communicate with each other. However, Mac addresses can be traced, and this can pose a security and privacy risk for users.\nNow back to Android devices. Android devices have a built-in Mac address that can be found in the device’s settings. Changing the Mac address of an Android device can help protect your privacy and prevent your device from being tracked by hackers or other malicious parties.\nSo, how can you change the Mac address of your Android device? Here’s the secret trick:\nStep 1: First, you need to enable the developer options on your Android device. To do this, go to your device’s settings, scroll down to ‘About Phone’ and tap on it. Next, scroll down to ‘Build Number’ and tap on it seven times until you see the message ‘You are now a developer!’\nStep 2: Now go back to the ‘Settings’ menu and tap on ‘Developer Options.’ Scroll down to ‘Networking’ and select ‘Wi-Fi MAC Address.’\nStep 3: Select the ‘Random’ option to change the Mac address of your Android device. You can also enter a custom Mac address if you prefer.\nStep 4: Restart your Android device to apply the changes.\nAnd there you have it - changing the Mac address of your Android device is that easy! By changing your device’s Mac address, you can protect your privacy and increase security while using your device.\nRemember that changing your Mac address may affect how your device connects to networks and may cause some issues with certain apps or services. It is always important to keep your device’s software and security up to date as well. But with this secret trick, you can take that extra step towards increased privacy and security with ease.\nYou can change your Media Access Control access to make your Android activities private over the WiFi or other wireless networks in an Android device. Just follow the below post to proceed.\nWhy would you change your Mac Address? Well, this is one question that would come to your mind as there’s a golden rule that if something isn’t broken, why would you try to fix it? Similarly, if there’s no need to change the MAC address, why would one want to change. Let me answer this question in detail. Look, privacy is important nowadays, and through the MAC address, one can easily track your device. This is why users often want to change their MAC address after purchasing a smartphone. If you connect to the Public WiFi network more often, it becomes important to change the MAC address at regular intervals. There are actually plenty of reasons behind changing the MAC address, but out of all those, privacy is the most important one.\nSteps To Change the MAC Address Of your Android Device Changing the MAC Address of your smartphone is easy as long as you have a rooted Android device. It’s possible to change the MAC address of a non-rooted device, but there’s no guarantee on whether the method will work or not. Below, we have shared the two best methods to change the MAC Address of your Android smartphone.\nCheck The MAC address Of Your Android Device: You need to check out your MAC Address first on your Android device. For that, you have to tap on Menu \u003e Settings \u003e About device \u003e MAC Address. This method requires a rooted Android smartphone to work as you need to run BusyBox and Terminal on an Android smartphone. If you have a rooted device, follow some of the simple steps given below. Step 1. First of all, you need to root your Android device; if you have not rooted your Android yet, you can head to the complete rooting process here.\nStep 2. Now in your Android, download and install the app BusyBox. Step 3. Now after installing Busybox, install the Terminal in your Android. Step 4. Now open the terminal and type su, and press enter. It will ask you for superuser access to grant it if you want to see your current MAC address, type “busy box iplink show eth0″ and press enter.\nStep 5. Now type “busybox ifconfig eth0 hw ether XX:XX:XX:XX:XX: XX” (without quotation marks)\nIt would be best if you replaced XX:XX:XX:XX:XX: XX with your new MAC address; you can write any alternative MAC address that you want to assign to your device. That’s it! You are done; you have successfully changed your Android MAC address. You can check your new MAC Address by just typing ” busy box link show eth0 ” in Terminal.\n2. Using ES File Explorer Well, ES File Explorer is removed from the Google Play Store for several reasons. However, you can download the file explorer from third-party sources to change the MAC address of your Android. This method works on non-rooted Android smartphones also. Let’s check out how to change Mac Address using ES File Explorer 2019. Step 1. First of all, you need to root your Android device. Then download and install ES file explorer on your Android smartphone.\nStep 2. Now open the ES File Explorer and then enable the option “Show Hidden Files” from the settings panel.\nStep 3. Now you need to browse the folder named “EFS.”\nStep 4. Now you need to find and open the folder called “WiFi.”\nStep 5. Now you will see two folders named “mac. cob” and “mac.info.” Now you need to open the “mac. cob” folder using the text editor.\nStep 6. Now you will get to see your mac address; you can edit and, after editing, save it.\nThat’s it! You are done. You will now be using the new MAC address.\n3. Using Change My MAC Android App Well, Change My MAC is another best app available on the Google Play Store that lets you change the MAC Address. However, the app requires a rooted device to run. Follow some of the simple steps given below to use the Change My MAC Android app. Step 1. First of all, download \u0026 install Change My MAC on your Android.\nStep 2. Open the app and grant the superuser permissions. Step 3. Now you need to create a new profile. Enter the name, interface type, and MAC Address.\nStep 4. You can create multiple profiles via Change My MAC.\nStep 5. You can even edit the existing profiles. To do that, click on the ‘Edit’ icon.\nStep 6. To set the MAC Address, tap on the ‘Tick’ button.\nThat’s it! You are done. This is how you can use Change My MAC to change your MAC address. I hope this article helped you!
