Have you ever wondered if changing your Android’s serial number is even possible? A lot of people do, especially when they want to make their devices work better or bypass certain restrictions set by a manufacturer or other service providers. If you are one of those people, then you are in luck – we have a secret hack that can help you do just that in just five easy steps!\nBut before we dive into the steps, let’s first understand what a serial number is and why it’s important.\nWhat is an Android Serial Number? An Android serial number, also known as the device’s hardware serial number, is a unique identifier that is assigned to each Android device by its manufacturer. This number is used primarily to identify a particular device and is used by service providers to keep track of inventory, warranty claims, and other related activities. In other words, it’s a way for manufacturers and providers to keep tabs on each piece of hardware they ship out.\nAside from tracking and inventory purposes, an Android serial number can also be used to check if a device is genuine or not. Each device has a unique serial number that is recorded in a manufacturing database, which can be checked against the serial number on the device to verify its authenticity.\nWhy Change Your Android’s Serial Number? There are several reasons why you might want to change your device’s serial number. Here are a few:\nTo bypass restrictions set by the manufacturer or service provider To hide your device’s identity from trackers and snoopers To avoid being blacklisted by service providers or carriers To make your device run faster or smoother Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s move on to the good stuff – how to change your Android’s serial number!\n5 Easy Steps to Change Your Android’s Serial Number Step 1: Back up your data\nBefore you attempt to change your Android’s serial number, it’s important to back up your data. This is necessary in case anything goes wrong during the process. You can use any backup tool or software of your choice.\nStep 2: Enable USB debugging\nTo change your device’s serial number, you’ll need to enable USB debugging on your device. To do this, go to your device’s “Developer options” and toggle on the “USB debugging” option.\nStep 3: Install ADB and fastboot drivers\nTo change your device’s serial number, you’ll need to download and install ADB and fastboot drivers on your computer. You can find these drivers on various third-party websites or from the official Android developer website.\nStep 4: Connect your Android device to your computer\nUsing your charging cable, connect your Android device to your computer. Wait for the “USB debugging” prompt to appear on your device and authorize the connection.\nStep 5: Run the following command\nNow that you’ve set up everything, it’s time to change your Android’s serial number. Open the command prompt on your computer and run the following command:\nadb shell\rsu\recho -n 'newserialnumber' \u003e /sys/class/android_usb/android0/iSerial Remember to replace “newserialnumber” with the new serial number you want to assign to your device. Once the command has been executed, reboot your device.\nAnd voila! Your Android’s serial number has been successfully changed.\nFinal Thoughts Changing your Android’s serial number can be a useful hack, but it’s important to note that it comes with certain risks. Changing the serial number can void your device’s warranty and potentially harm your device. It’s important to proceed with caution and follow the steps carefully to avoid any issues.\nAdditionally, while changing your device’s serial number may help you bypass certain restrictions or avoid being blacklisted, it’s not a foolproof solution. Service providers and manufacturers have sophisticated systems in place to detect and identify devices, and changing your serial number may only provide temporary relief.\nIn conclusion, changing your Android’s serial number is a worthwhile hack to know, but it should be done with caution and with full knowledge of the possible implications. As always, proceed at your own risk!\nThe serial number is usually listed as an ‘S/N’ on the smartphone’s box. The serial number is useful for device service, replacement or warranty.
