Email management is a daily task that can become incredibly tedious, overwhelming and distracting. In today’s fast-paced environment, it is crucial to utilize the tools at our disposal to streamline this process and optimize our productivity. Gmail labels are a fantastic tool to help us accomplish this. In this article, we’ll show you how to revolutionize your email game by supercharging your Gmail labels, and skyrocketing your productivity in the process!\nWhat are Gmail Labels? Gmail Labels are like digital tags that you can attach to your emails. These labels help you organize your emails according to various criteria that you choose. For example, you can label emails by sender, subject, and content, to name a few. Gmail labels are highly customizable and can be used in a way that suits your individual needs.\nWhy Use Gmail Labels? Using Gmail labels helps optimize your email management process in several ways. Firstly, they make it easier to find specific emails even if you have thousands of them in your inbox. Secondly, you can prioritize and reply to important emails more quickly. Thirdly, It helps reduce email clutter and helps you devise a system for resistance which saves time, reduce stress and increase productivity.\nSupercharging Your Gmail Labels Now that you understand the benefits of Gmail Labels let’s take a look at ways to supercharge them!\nCreate a Labeling System The first step is to create a labeling system that suits your needs. Start by thinking about the types of emails you receive and how you want to organize them. For example, creating labels for emails that require action, emails that are important or urgent, emails that are for reference, and emails that need to be filed.\nUse Filters Gmail provides a powerful filtering system that allows you to automate the labeling process based on certain criteria. For example, you can set up a filter that labels all emails from a particular sender or all emails with a particular keyword in the subject line.\nColor-Code your Labels Adding color coding to your labels enhances their visual appeal, making it easier to identify labels at a glance. It is useful when you need to process large volumes of emails quickly. It can also help you organize and prioritize email based on their importance, urgency, and other criteria you define for yourself.\nCreate Sub-Labels Sub-labels help you break down complex labeling systems and make it easier to navigate through your emails by defining subcategories for email topics.\nUse Keyboard Shortcuts Using Gmail keyboard shortcuts can save a lot of time and clicks, and allows you to move emails around quickly, mark emails as unread or read, or apply labels in a breeze. Learn them, memorize them, and put them to use!\nArchive Old Messages When archive unnecessary emails, it declutters your inbox, frees up space and makes it easier to locate important emails. You can create filters that place emails that are over a certain age or that meet certain criteria into an archive label. When the label isn’t needed anymore, you can mass delete all of it or move it to a dedicated storage label, freeing up valuable storage space in Gmail.\nFinal Thoughts The ability to effectively manage your email is a critical component of productivity. With Gmail Labels, you now have a tool to organize your inbox, make it more efficient, reduce stress, increase productivity and get work done faster. With a little bit of planning and customization, you too can become an email super user! So what are you waiting for? Supercharge your Gmail Labels today and revolutionize your email game!\nSay, for instance, you get daily (or maybe hourly) emails from a specific sender and you want to not only make sure you don’t miss them as they arrive, but you also want to be able to quickly find them (without having to resort to using the search tool. How do you do that? With labels. I’m going to show you a few of the fundamental things you should know about labels. Once you’ve mastered Gmail labels (a feature that’s been around for a very long time), you’ll find the cloud-based email service to be considerably easier to manage. With that said, let’s get to the labels.\nKeeping track of your labels I hadn’t touched labels in some time. They were working as expected and it had been a while since I needed to create a new label or manage them. Much to my surprise, there were so many labels I’d either forgotten about or other services created automatically (when they were connected). How do you find out this information? Let me show you.\n1. Open Settings Log in to Gmail and click the gear icon in the top right corner. From the pop-up menu (Figure 1), click See All Settings. In the resulting window, click the Labels tab to reveal all of your current Gmail labels (Figure 2). When I saw the vast number of labels associated with my Gmail account, I knew I needed to seriously thin the herd. You’ll probably find the same thing. Here’s what you can do:\nScan through the list and click Hide for any label you think you might no longer need.Scan through the list and click remove for any label you know you no longer need.\nAfter deleting (or hiding) all of the unwanted labels, you can close out the Settings window.\nCreating new labels For me, it was all about starting from square one. To that end, I culled nearly all of the labels associated with my account (minus the System Labels, which you can’t delete). With that clean slate, I could then go back and create only the labels I needed.\n1. Locate a target message To create a label, locate an email in your inbox that will be associated with that label. Say, for example, you receive a daily email from your team manager. Locate one of those messages in your inbox.\n2. Create a new label based on that message Once you’ve located the message in question, right-click it and select Label As (Figure 3). In the resulting pop-up, click Create New (Figure 4).\n3. Name and next your label In the pop-up window (Figure 5), give your new label a name and (optionally) select a parent label for the new child. Click Create and your new label is ready.\nColor-coding your labels One thing you cannot do when creating a new label is associate a color. I’ve found giving a label a specific color makes it considerably easier to make it stand out in your inbox.\n1. Reveal the folder/label pane To color-code your new label you must reveal the label listing in the left pane. How you do this will depend on if you’re using the new Gmail interface or the old one. With the new interface, I simply hover my cursor over the mail button to reveal my folders and labels (Figure 6).\n2. Add a color to a label Locate the label you want to color code and hover your cursor over it to reveal the three-dot menu button. Click that button and then click Label Color. From the new pop-up window (Figure 7), select the color you want to be associated with the label and you’re good to go. And that, my dear Gmail-using friends, is how you can better manage the labels in Google’s cloud-based mail service. Enjoy that improved workflow!\n","wordCount":"1255","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-11T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-11T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Louis Thompson"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://godekfredes.github.io/posts/how-to-better-manage-gmail-labels-and-why-you-should-1915905/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Godekfredes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://godekfredes.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Godekfredes (Alt + H)"><img src=https://godekfredes.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Godekfredes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://godekfredes.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Revolutionize Your Email Game: Learn How to Supercharge Your Gmail Labels and Skyrocket Your Productivity!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-11 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 11, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1255 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Louis Thompson</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#what-are-gmail-labels>What are Gmail Labels?</a></li><li><a href=#why-use-gmail-labels>Why Use Gmail Labels?</a></li><li><a href=#supercharging-your-gmail-labels>Supercharging Your Gmail Labels</a><ul><li><a href=#create-a-labeling-system>Create a Labeling System</a></li><li><a href=#use-filters>Use Filters</a></li><li><a href=#color-code-your-labels>Color-Code your Labels</a></li><li><a href=#create-sub-labels>Create Sub-Labels</a></li><li><a href=#use-keyboard-shortcuts>Use Keyboard Shortcuts</a></li><li><a href=#archive-old-messages>Archive Old Messages</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</a></li><li><a href=#keeping-track-of-your-labels>Keeping track of your labels</a><ul><li><a href=#1-open-settings>1.
