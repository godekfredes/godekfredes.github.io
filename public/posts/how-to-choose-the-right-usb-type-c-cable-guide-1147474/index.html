This Guide Will Save Your Device!\nAs more and more devices are embracing the USB Type-C standard for charging and data transfer, many users are facing problems with compatibility and performance. The USB Type-C standard is supposed to offer greater convenience, speed, and versatility, but if you’re not using the right cable, you could damage your device or compromise its functionality. Here’s a guide to help you identify and choose the right USB Type-C cable for your device.\nWhat is USB Type-C?\nUSB Type-C is a standard that was introduced in 2014 as a successor to the traditional USB-A and USB-B connectors. USB Type-C connectors are smaller, flatter, and reversible, which means you don’t have to worry about plugging them in the right way. They are also capable of faster data transfer speeds, more power delivery, and more versatile functionality than previous USB connectors.\nWhy You Need the Right USB Type-C Cable?\nAlthough USB Type-C connectors are a standard, they don’t always have the same features or protocols. Some USB Type-C cables are designed for charging only, while others are for data transfer, video output, or fast charging. The wrong cable can lead to slow charging, data corruption, or even damage to your device, especially if it’s not designed to handle the voltage or amperage that your device requires. That’s why it’s essential to choose the right USB Type-C cable, even if it means spending a little extra money.\nHow to Identify the Right USB Type-C Cable?\nTo identify the right USB Type-C cable, look for the following characteristics:\nSpeed Rating: USB Type-C cables come in different speed ratings, and some may not be compatible with your device’s speed requirements. Look for USB 3.1 Gen 1 or 2 cables if you want to take full advantage of high-speed data transfer, or USB Power Delivery (PD) cables if you need fast charging.\nCertification: USB Type-C cables that are certified by third-party organizations such as USB-IF, UL, or FCC are more likely to meet the highest standards for safety and performance. Check for certification logos or labels on the cable or packaging.\nAmpere Rating: USB Type-C cables come in various amperage ratings, ranging from 1A to 3A or more. Make sure the cable you choose can handle the amperage that your device requires. Higher amperage cables are usually better for fast charging, but they can also generate more heat and stress on your device.\nLength: USB Type-C cables come in different lengths, and longer cables can be more convenient for charging or data transfer, but they can also cause voltage drop and slow down charging or data transfer speeds. Shorter cables are better for fast charging and high-speed data transfer.\nBrand: Finally, choose a trusted brand that has a good reputation for quality and customer support. Avoid cheap, generic cables that may not be designed or tested to the same standards as premium brands.\nConclusion\nUSB Type-C is a powerful and versatile standard that can enhance your device’s functionality, but it’s essential to choose the right cable to avoid compatibility issues, damage, or reduced performance. By identifying the right speed rating, certification, amperage rating, length, and brand, you can ensure that your USB Type-C cable will work seamlessly with your device and provide the speed and convenience you need. Don’t take chances with your device by using the wrong USB Type-C cable – invest in the right one and enjoy worry-free charging and data transfer!\nThe trouble is brewing The issue here lies in the differential power delivery, while Nexus 6P and the Nexus 5X support 3A fast charging, charging with a bad cable would result in either frying your USB port or in some cases the entire device itself, mind you it’s a serious permanent damage to your device. This can happen due to many shortcomings in the cables, primarily the wrong choice of resistors and missing of the SuperSpeed wires.\nChecking the cables It is understandable that you would want to buy an extra USB Type-C cable to work in tandem with the power banks or your car chargers. The Type-C Cable on the Google Store is a safe bet but if you still want to buy from other sources, here is how you can safely do so. If you are an advanced smartphone user or have been known to tweak around with Android phones, this post will explain how you can run shell commands in ADB to detect on whether the cable is good. Alternatively, here is a much simpler and efficient way to check the quality of the cables. Download an app called Checkr from this link. After installing the app, plugin the cable to be tested to a laptop. The app may ask you to remove and replug the charging cable post which the results will be displayed. Just make sure that the cable is not connected to the charging device as the same would have better insulation from power surges and would not display accurate results. On the hitherto, the microUSB to Type-C adapters have come in handy and they do work as intended. The app measures the current from the charging cable and although the app test might not be 100 percent accurate, it is still the only way to test the cable and it has worked out well for me. On a related note here is a frequently updated list of USB Type-C cables which work fine.
