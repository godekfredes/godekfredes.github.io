The internet is a vast and wondrous place, offering endless opportunities for entertainment, education, and communication. Unfortunately, some websites and services are not accessible from certain locations, limiting the accessibility of the internet for millions. The good news is, there is an easy solution to this problem: changing your IP address.\nAn IP address is a unique identifier assigned to your device that allows other devices to communicate with it over the internet. Most internet service providers (ISPs) assign a dynamic IP address to their customers, meaning that it can change each time you connect to the internet. However, ISPs often associate your IP address with a specific region, restricting access to certain websites and services that are not available in that area.\nThankfully, changing your IP address is a relatively simple process that can be done on both Windows and Mac operating systems.\nChanging Your IP Address on Windows To change your IP address on Windows, simply follow these easy steps:\nClick on “Start” and type “cmd” in the search bar to open the command prompt.\nType “ipconfig /release” into the command prompt and hit enter. This will release your current IP address.\nType “ipconfig /renew” into the command prompt and hit enter. This will assign a new IP address to your device.\nAnd that’s it! Your IP address has now been changed, giving you unrestricted web access.\nChanging Your IP Address on Mac Changing your IP address on a Mac is just as simple. Follow these steps to unlock unrestricted web access:\nClick on the Apple icon in the top left corner of your screen and select “System Preferences.”\nClick on “Network” and select your active network connection (Wi-Fi or Ethernet).\nClick on the “Advanced” button in the bottom right corner of the window.\nClick on the “TCP/IP” tab.\nClick on the “Renew DHCP Lease” button.\nAnd just like that, your IP address has been changed, giving you unrestricted web access.\nConclusion Changing your IP address is a simple and effective way to bypass location restrictions and gain unrestricted web access. With just a few clicks, you can unlock a whole new world of online content and services. So go ahead, give it a try and enjoy the freedom of the open web!\nIP Address basically serves as a location address for the device on which you are using the internet. Sometimes, it’s better to assign a PC it’s own IP Address rather than relying on the one assigned by the router.\nChange Your IP Address in Windows \u0026 MAC You can easily change the IP Address in Windows and Mac computer. So, in this article, we are going to share some of the best working methods to change your IP Address in Windows \u0026 Mac. Unplug the Modem/Broadband If you are connecting to the internet over a dial-up modem, your ISP will assign your PC a different IP address each time you connect. Therefore if you need to change the IP address simply try disconnecting and reconnecting. If you are a broadband user then you might be assigned with a Static IP address which means you have to disconnect your broadband from your computer over a larger period of time (4-5 Hours). Simply remove the coaxial cables from your broadband and leave it for 4-5 hours and reconnect it. You will get the new IP address.\nUsing Network Setting If you want to assign a new IP Address to Windows 10 computer, then you need to follow this method. In this method, we are going to use the Network \u0026 Sharing center to assign a new IP Address. Step 1. Click on Windows search and search for Network and Sharing Center. Open the first one from the list. Step 2. Now click on the ‘Change Adapter Settings’ option. Step 3. Now Right-click on the network in which you are currently being connected. Select ‘Properties’. Step 4. Double-click on Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv4). Step 5. Click on Use the following IPv4 address. Now type any IP address which you want to set. Double-check the Validate button at the bottom and then click OK. That’s it! you have changed your IP address. Now your system will have the new IP address assigned by you. Now every packet sent to the Networking layer will have the IP address that you have assigned.\nCheck Your IP Address After following the methods given above, you need to check to confirm whether the IP has been changed or not. To check your current IP Address, follow the steps given below. Step 1. Click on Start and there type “CMD” and then press “Enter” this will open the command prompt. Step 2. Now you need to type “ipconfig” in CMD and then press enter. This will eventually show you the current IP address along with IPv4 address, Subnet Mask, and IPv6 address.\nChange IP Address In Mac OS Just like Windows 10 computer, you can change the IP Address in MAC PC as well. Follow some of the steps given below to change the IP Address in MacOS. Step 1. Click on the Apple logo at the right top corner of the desktop. Select “System Preferences” from the drop-down list. Step 2. Now click on the ‘Network’ icon (the icon with silver color). Step 3. Now select the network which you want to connect either wifi, broadband, or any other network. Now click on the ‘Advanced’ button. Step 4. Now select the TCP/IP tab at the top. Step 5. Now select the “Manually” option on the Configure IPv4 option. Step 6. Now enter the IP address you want to set. Also, enter the subnet mask there. Now click on the ‘Ok’ button at the right. By this, your IP address will be changed. You can also revert back the settings to automatic that will set your IP address that will be provided by your network.\nUsing VPN Virtual Private Network (VPN) is the tool that protects you from various online scams by hiding your IP address. It automatically connects you to a different IP address. VPN encrypts your incoming and outgoing traffic so that your ISP or hackers can’t spy on your online activities.\n1. Cyberghost VPN Well, CyberGhost VPN launches both – browser session and a VPN connection, in 1 click. CyberGhost VPN is 100% customizable and it offers you lots of servers with different IP Addresses. The VPN tool is available for both Windows and macOS.\n2. NordVPN This is another best VPN service that you can use on your Windows computer. NordVPN uses the double VPN technology that encrypts data not once, but twice. The VPN service has over 2643 worldwide server locations in 56 different countries. NordVPN never logs what you do and where you go on the Internet.\n3. ExpressVPN This one uses 256-bit encryption to secure your online connection. If you are looking for ultra-fast VPN servers then this is the best one for you. ExpressVPN provides access across 94 countries. You can access any blocked content using Express VPN.\n4. Tunnelbear Well, TunnelBear is one of the best free VPN services available for desktop and mobile operating systems. You will find the Tunnelbear app on almost every platform including Windows, Android, iOS, Linux, etc. The great thing about Tunnelbear is that its a free VPN service and it provides users a wide range of servers. Servers are located in different locations, which means you will get a unique IP Address. It also secures your traffic with AES 256- bit encryption.\n5. Surfeasy It is another best VPN service on the list which you can use to change your IP Address. Just like all other VPN services, Surfeasy is also compatible with iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows operating systems. It’s available in two versions – Free and Premium. The free version offers users limit bandwidth, but it encrypts your traffic.\nUsing TOR Browser Well, TOR is basically a computer network that’s run by volunteers worldwide. Each volunteer runs what is called a relay. Well, the relay is just a computer that runs the software allowing users all over the world to connect via the TOR network. Well, before connecting you to the web, the TOR Network connects to several different relays which helps to delete all the footprints. Step 1. First of all, download and install the TOR Browser on your computer. Well, this browser is basically a modified version of Firefox. Step 2. Once you have downloaded the installation file of tor, you need to install it. Step 3. After the installation, you need to open the Tor Browser and you will see a pop-up window which will ask you whether you’d like to connect directly to the TOr network or if you would like to configure the proxy settings. Step 4. Click on the ‘Connect’ button. A version of Firefox will launch and you will be connected to the TOR network. To make sure you’re connected to the TOR visit the site whatismyip.com to detect the location based on your IP Address. This is how you can change your IP address on your computer using Tor Browser. Changing the IP address to your desired IP address may break your connection with the main server and you might not able to access the internet, at that stage you will have to revert back the IP address to an automatic state.
