However, the rise of digital currencies also means that there are greater risks of hackers attempting to steal your computer’s power to mine cryptocurrencies without your knowledge or consent. This is by far the newest form of hacking, also known as “cryptojacking”. With this in mind, it can be hard to know how to protect your computer from cryptojacking. But don’t worry, there are ways to block it using your web browser.\nHere are the three easy steps that you can follow to protect your computer from cryptojacking and stop hackers from stealing your computer’s power:\nStep 1: Get a Browser Extension The first step that you need to take to protect your computer from cryptojacking is to install a browser extension in your web browser. There are several extensions that you can choose from, such as NoCoin, MinerBlock, and AntiMiner. These browser extensions are designed to block any attempts to mine cryptocurrency without your knowledge or consent.\nStep 2: Configure Your Browser Extension Once you’ve installed the browser extension, you need to configure it. The configuration process varies depending on the extension that you choose. However, most of these extensions are easy to configure as they come with user-friendly interfaces. In most cases, all you need to do is to enable the extension and it will start blocking mining scripts automatically.\nStep 3: Test Your Browser Extension The last step that you need to take to protect your computer from cryptojacking is to test your browser extension. You can do this by visiting a website that is known to have a mining script embedded in it. If your browser extension is working properly, it should block the mining script and you won’t experience any slowdowns in your computer’s performance.\nIn conclusion, cryptojacking is a serious threat to your computer’s security and performance. However, by following these simple steps, you can protect your computer from cryptojacking and stop hackers from stealing your computer’s power. By installing a browser extension, configuring it, and testing it, you can ensure that your computer stays safe and secure while browsing the internet. Don’t let hackers steal your computer’s power to mine cryptocurrency, start protecting it today!\nThe Pirate Bay team later confirmed that they were testing a new method to generate money. Users will feel a sudden slowness in their computer whenever they visit a site that mines digital currencies. Let me tell you, this practice is nothing new, but the Pirate Bay was the first popular torrent site that was seen using a digital currency miner. What makes this thing worse? Well, any website owner can use this new technique to generate revenue without users’ permission.\nBlock Cryptocurrency Mining In Your Web Browser Bitcoin mining malware is rising in popularity at an aggressive rate. Here’s how you can spot a website that is using your web browser to mine crypto-coins If you ever visited a website and felt a sudden slowness in your computer? There could be possible chances that your web browser is running a script to mine cryptocurrencies. The best way to spot the miner is by checking the CPU usage. You can use this technique to see if a particular website is slaving your processor and earning money. Look for those huge spikes in your CPU usage.\nHow To Block Crypto Currency Miners Well, there are not one but a few ways to block CryptoCurrency miners from running. For that, you must keep your PC’s Task Manager open as you visit websites. An unnecessary and sudden spike in CPU usage is a clear indication of Cryptocurrency mining. If you feel that a site is silently mining cryptocurrency, you can avoid visiting such websites.\nBlocking It Manually The manual process to block cryptocurrency miners on your computer exists. This way, you can block particular domains that you find harmful or irritating. For that, you need to visit this article to learn how to block websites on a Windows computer. If you are using a Linux computer, you need to open the host file by running the following command and add 0.0.0.0 coin-hive.com at the end. Enter these command sudo nano /private/etc/hosts Now on the windows operating system, you need to navigate to C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc and edit the host file to add 0.0.0.0 coin-hive.com at the end.\nUsing minerBlock Extension This extension allows users to block cryptocurrency miners in the web browser. This extension can automatically block miners for you.\nUsing Ad Blocker Adblock is indeed a great extension for blocking ads. However, you can also block a script using Adblocker. Install the Ad Blocker extension and then go to Customize \u003e Block an ad by its URL. Then add the following URL in the text box https://coin-hive.com/lib/coinhive.min.js\nUsing NoScript Well, NoScript is for Firefox users only. This javascript-blocking extension is powerful enough to block crypto miners in the web browser. However, the script is very powerful and can break many websites because it disables all scripts running on pages. This extension will make you safe from digital miners. However, check your CPU usage whenever you feel a sudden slowness in your computer. So, what do you think about this?
